<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The roofbar was crowded as always and full of life. A veritable fixture at the top of one of the most salient skyscrapers in the Silom area of Bangkok, touted as one of the best rooftop bars in the world. Where wealth flowed, a respectful demeanor and anonymity held. A guilty pleasure of the friends even back in university days when they could scarcely make ends meet, it was their place to come and dream. Even then they dressed and looked the part, and now, upon reflection, they both had made it real.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat sat at a corner table, just a bit early. A few minutes passed and as if by instinct she looked up immediately as the door produced the figure of Koona.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Well, a new version of Koona.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Which she swore at this moment had become just a little larger than life. She exuded a confidence and poise Cat had never seen before in her and was looking simply…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Gorgeous._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat nodded internally… yes, that was the word…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was not the basically pretty but serious and kind of invisible girl she knew. This was a woman, a woman with…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Something special._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Like an added dimension to her person had sprouted.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona wore slender black pleated slacks and a form fitting blue button down dress shirt, sleeves folded up at the cuffs, showcasing a silver link bracelet and a matching chain hanging from her neck. Enough glimmer to catch attention and yet calling out that the best is…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Uh… under those clothes._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_WTF Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona’s waist was Thai-tiny as ever and although her torso was still long and slender as ever, her breasts had filled out even a bit more. Or maybe it was how she walked. This was a woman who owned herself, all confidence and self assurance. And not a facade, Cat could feel this was real.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She had clearly grown the last year into her own. That needed not be spoken. The natural oscillating opposition of her hips, ribs and shoulders along with her perfectly poised neck commanded attention. Her head straight and chin slightly angled down, her gaze powerful through the upper half of her eyes. Her straight subtly highlighted dark brown hair, long before, was now cut angled straight and hanging just an inch or two above her shoulder and swayed along with her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Catching Cat’s eye, which she held through her trademark furrowed sockets, a slight smile came over her upper lip, showing her upper teeth. By the time reaching the table, a full warm toothy brilliant smile she had rarely ever shown in the past bathed Cat. A smile that said too much. Of course which made Cat take a breath of relief, but also uncomfortable just a bit without knowing why.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Hello ka!” they smiled in unison, as Cat rose and they embraced almost a little too long. Cat knew because she was looking up into those perfectly painted eyes and saw a glint too much. Knowing better than to repeat the past, Koona let go and made back for her chair.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

From nowhere a pang of envy - or was it jealousy? - hit Cat, with the realization that the woman in front of her had clearly _lived_ this past year. Even that she herself had been the one to push her away, it still held. What had Koona done and seen? Because whatever it was, it liked her, and people didn’t flower this way in a vacuum.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sooooo…” smiled Koona, raising a brow slightly, prompting Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smiled and laughed nervously as she looked back at the best friend she had ever had. This was not going to be a game. Cards would be on the table this evening.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I missed you so much Koona. I’m sorry, I didn’t know what to do. I’ve been so alone in my heart. You are my best friend and always will be even if you tell me you never want to see me again.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Why didn’t you call ka? It’s like you just let things go and gave up na ka,” she intoned, adding the polite particles at the end, there was some magic of a close friend giving respect and distance in such intimacy. Something only Thai speakers and similar languages would ever know the melting heart of such a feeling inside.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat had no answer of reason she could consciously give, “I’m sorry ka.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, I guess its true, maybe I sprung that moment on you? But you were there too. I thought you felt it. If I was wrong and scared you, I am so sorry. I didn’t mean to. Okay, I mean, I felt it but you know what I mean. I guess… I… I just hoped.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So you liked me that way?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m sorry Cat, it's more than like,” then correcting herself, “was more than like.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Something in Cat wilted at Koona’s correction like the same stupid envy-like emotion that she couldn’t understand.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I like women,” Koona intoned with the ‘come on’ childlike whine, “That night, well, after you pushed away, I gave up the charade and just accepted it completely. Cried a fuckload. I guess… I mean I was not thinking… with you… it could have…” she cleared her throat and smiled the ‘I said too much’ smile,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Anyhow, this past year, beyond a shadow of a doubt, I know. Its just who I am, it’s not just you,” she paused contemplating her water glass, tipping it a bit on the side with her perfect short clipped unpainted finger nail, “But really, I am first a woman, a friend, with a good heart, only after that a lover or mate. So don’t worry if you don’t feel the same. It’s okay. That’s how life is. It’s okay. I get it. I felt bad after that day. After I got over the sadness it’s true, I could have called you just as well. But I got busy.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Koona got busy.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How busy?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Something in Cat would have done anything to turn back time to have kept that heartbreak from Koona. Was she just empathetic? Was that it? She couldn’t imagine ever intentionally hurting this being in front of her. But not only that. Was it really heartbreak she wanted to take back?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona 2.0 was in front of her. Her heart felt jeopardy knowing that to become this… she had done things, who she was, and what those things must have been…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The women…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Who had Koona been with?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat caught herself as Koona interrupted her brief daydream,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But anyway, we can talk forever about this, what made you call me?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I created a disaster and broke another heart.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Not that you missed and wanted to see me?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Oh fuck.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I caused a hurt and somehow it woke me up to how much I miss having my best friend.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So a guy?” Koona let Cat off the hook, but it made her sad that maybe this was a mistake, to see each other again, “Er, because Cat, that would not be news of any sort”, she smiled her “I’ll humor you” smile broadly breaking herself from her rumination.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Who cares Koona, I’m me and I’m seeing an old friend._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Shit, it was almost a game for us back then! Damn marks on our bedposts, even if we never brought them there,” she laughed and then playfully added, “at least as far as I know about you!” she flitted her eyebrows suggestively.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat blushed but the train was already in motion so she put some momentum to it, “Well, I met this amazing farang man. Well I don’t know if I can say man. He looked like a rockstar, you know, combat boots, tight clothes, makeup. His name is - was - Mali.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Wow, okay, this is new,” Koona savored the information, “Mali, like meaning the flower bush in Thai, no?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yes,” Cat chuckled realizing she had never really made the connection for some reason, and so fitting that Mali’s name referred to the flower plant, not the flower itself as if it was itself it’s own hint about $er identity,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“We got close - first as friends, emotionally. Then there was one night,” Cat paused wondering how to simply summarize everything, “Koona, he - she - is not a rockstar, thinks he - she - is katoey.” Cat looked down, still ashamed about how the whole thing went down with Mali.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“He - she - told you?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“In bits. Then the night we were together. I can’t tell you. It was like magic. He didn’t tell me. I _saw_ her. I think. When we were together.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh my god!” Koona exclaimed smiling with a little bounce in her seat. Cat made an immediate mental note that this was in fact Koona 2.0 because in the past the ‘wow’ would probably have been an ‘eeeewww’ accompanied by a concerned frown.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So then what? Did you, you know?” Koona winked all too seductively.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded unable to speak the words to Koona’s dropped jaw.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_God, when did she learn that look?!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Had she always been this way but I’d not noticed?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Is this how female friends look at each other?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat had never wondered about such things before.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Shit I’m self-conscious right now.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Why?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was getting rocked. She was the master of poise and since Koona walked in she could not even orient herself.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So come on, then what?” Koona cooed as Cat started to doubt her own unquestioned grip on reality.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I ended it. Well I told him - her - that I wanted a man only.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And you do? Because last time I checked you were not exactly hot for them. Or for anyone,” swallowing the last phrase that was still begging for release…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And certainly not for me…_ _I may know how to be a real friend…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But I’m still a hot blooded woman damn it…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat met her friends eyes while hers filled with tears. Koona reached across the table and took her hand in her two palms and squeezed gently, “Cat, it’s okay, I’m still me, you can still tell me everything. I won’t judge you. Much less now than ever.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat shook her head,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Its just that I feel I can’t see straight anymore. I used to be so clear, now I am so confused. And unhappy.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cat can’t see straight.” Koona stated matter-of-fact and smiled deviously with the words holding gaze as Cat crescendoed into a full blush. Koona felt just a bit mean but it was so worth it, and Cat deserved it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After enjoying the moment of her impeccably poised friends embarrassment, Koona interjected, “So, you don’t have to tell me but when you made love with Mali, you saw her as a woman?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat took a breath to survey the elephant she’d been boarding in her room up to now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Uhm, I can’t lie, yes,” she squinted her brows and eyes moving down beginning in vein to work on a subsequent thought that would save her as Koona waited patiently. She wasn’t going to mention the images of Koona which kept hitting her starting that night. Nor the role she herself had found come so natural there.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You know, I’ve never felt that way before. With a man. It wasn’t aggressive, contrived or difficult, there wasn’t even a _goal_, it was just softness, so incredibly soft and easy. I mean, once I helped Mali let go of… I guess of what the world programs males to think they’re supposed to be.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Do you love her?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Apparently not, since yesterday I told HER she had to be a man to have me,” Cat furrowed her brows again, “But Koona, even so, even if so… I don’t think she is far enough along. I mean, she’s barely come to terms with who she is. Barely even on hormones. Hormones change people. You know my sister!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona paused thoughtfully for a moment taking it in,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, some of that may be valid. But acceptance of what one truly is can come in a moment,” Koona winked.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat’s heart fell. Once again, that unexpected feeling. How long could she ignore this and not probe deeper?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Koona, honestly, I clung - wanted to cling to him - because I thought he was the one amazing perfect man in existence. I didn’t consider further. He - she - had this feminine aspect. I mean, the way it felt to spend time together, walk in the park, the way he played the piano, could talk and join with my family. It was just easy. But still a man. It made everyone happy. Including me, for once…”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat paused not knowing if she should say what was next on her tongue.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What the fuck then…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Spending time with Mali reminded me of how it feels to be with you. But he is a man… I thought…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She stared out over the balcony and out to the sky. Because there was something else she knew but yet didn’t understand. De-focused and dazing out, it felt like she was on the edge of something but could not say what in particular.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She had thought seeing Koona would clear things up but just in minutes everything just seemed much worse and even more blurred. She was expecting the old Koona who would get her back… box her up.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona broke the expanding chasm, “It’s getting late, you want to see my new digs?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Diiiiiggggs?” Cat questioned. Definitely Koona 2.0.&nbsp;
