Mali pushed $erself up the stairs to $er second floor apartment. Hot and just on the edge of sweaty from the late afternoon trek through town in the smoldering orange of late Chiang Rai afternoon sun. Plastic bags of vegetables and other miscellaneous groceries in hand, opening the door, $he released them on to the floor while taking $er shoes off.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had been looking forward to a quiet Friday evening and Saturday of unstructured relaxation and reflection, a contrast from how even here in Chiang Rai, $he structured $er time and productivity so much during the week. $he tried to make each Saturday a ‘sabbath’, $er own version of the Jewish tradition of taking a day for reflection and off from work.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not like all the stuck rules of the traditional Jews, to Mali, the only rule was to break patterns - to not do anything $he would normally do during the week, like wake up early, work, shop and run around carrying things in hand. Also no plans or schedules: Do what you want to NOW and then just do what comes next naturally. It was flexible and $he would add to the _prohibited_ list whenever $he would catch $erself getting wound up on this day. $he too loved the way the Jewish people - $er predecessors - started the sabbath the evening before.&nbsp;

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And for $er, the deal was that Friday night was movie night as $he didn’t watch tv or entertainment the rest of the week and $he was looking forward to it!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Just for good measure $he decided to check $er email one last time, as $he liked to take the day - aside from the movie night - off from all computing devices.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was an email from Cat. $he clicked it open. Simply written, with the greeting to Mali in Thai script as Cat had been helping $er learn during their Skype calls,

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

> สวัสดีคุณมาลีค่ะ_,_
> 
> I’m coming to Chiang Mai for the weekend to see my family. Do you want to come down? Maybe Sunday?
> 
> Cat :)

_Do I want to come down? What do you think, Cat?_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was perfect, a nice rest day and then $he’d go see Cat. This would normally have been all sorts of anxiety provoking for Mali given $er sense of closeness and wanting more of Cat, but strangely, it all felt transparent. To date they just flowed, really like great friends. They had seen each other in their night clothes and without makeup. They had shared some of their own deep wishes and feelings about what was going on in their lives. They even talked about Mali’s in between state and how $he felt. The only thing they did not talk about was what was going on between them, if anything else was.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Certain things Mali knew, and $he could swear there was something more going on than just friendship.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali easily replied,

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

> สวัสดี คุณ แมว ค่ะ,&nbsp;
> 
> OMG yes, I’ll look forward to it. I’ll go and buy an early bus ticket to Chiang Mai, get there about 9 or 10am on Sunday? Is that good?&nbsp;
> 
> Mali

For the heck of it after $er movie that night, Mali allowed the dispensation to check email again, and Cat had responded,

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

> Wonderful, I look forward to seeing you. Maybe we can go to Wat Doi Suthep, it’s the monastery high up the hill overlooking Chiang Mai. I have a feeling you’ll enjoy it.

<!-- /wp:quote -->

Mali texted Cat as the bus pulled into the Chiang Mai station,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Good morning :) I’m here!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was a bit after 10am. When the phone beeped with an almost immediate response, $he was pleasantly surprised, then caught off-guard by what it contained,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_My father suggested you come to our restaurant today. I think you’ll like._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Restaurant? Interesting. How big a deal could that be for a full day?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_We come to bus station and find you, okay?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s heart sunk a bit. $he had assumed, well, was thinking $he and Cat would spend time together - alone. Who is ‘we’? It kind of hurt. This is the kind of thing that women do when they _don’t_ want to be alone with someone. Invite a group. Often it was the point when $he'd make the realization that $he’d been in the friend-zone from the start.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But it was what it was. $he shook $er head realizing that despite the calmness in their conversations, $he’d never backed away from how $he’d felt since day one with Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With the acceptance out of the way, Mali then felt a pang of anxiety and insecurity. Other people - family - restaurant? It was the inner drive that kept $er rather isolated from others: feeling uncomfortable. Not so much uncomfortable in $erself, which was of course part, but $he thought more that $he felt uncomfortable that $he made others uncomfortable. But then, $he had seen the picture of Cat’s mother on Instagram and she seemed so down to earth. As if $he already knew her. So how bad could it be? Anyhow, there was no saying no.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Wonderful, see you soon!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What else could $he say? $he had no idea what he was getting into. Aside from a couple other Thai friends $he had met through a language exchange website, Cat was the third. But her family? Would they be there?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_OMFG!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat's polish and perfection had to have come from somewhere. $he shuddered and knew $he was in for something and it might be embarrassing. Even if they were nice to $er as they in all likelihood would be, it could be… awkward.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Why was Cat being so open - at first it was just Cat - but with her family? It seemed that Thai families were quite private, not to mention with foreigners.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All things considered, Mali was thankful that Cat had only informed $er of this now and not the other day.&nbsp;
