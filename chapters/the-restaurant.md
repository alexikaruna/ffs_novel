Over the hills and through the woods would certainly describe where they were going. After about forty minutes driving and admiring the lush country scenery from the dark tinted windows, from fields and tree lined roads to foothills and hilly curves, Cat announced that they were almost there, just up this hill a bit more.&nbsp;

The car deviated into a stone-laid driveway, through an arch created by intertwined bent trees on either side, and began making its way up a steeper incline. Passing what looked like a rustic wood cabin, they continued, some dogs catching up and running alongside the car, barking along the way, escorting them safely to a small gravel parking area.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As the car stopped, Cat whispered, “Were here,” then reached to open the door, through which she and then Mali stepped out into the warming day. The first thing Mali noticed was the air, although warm, was lighter, and not humid. $he inhaled deeply, seemingly for the first time in months, really since being in Thailand. Cat, picking up on it looked over,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“We’re higher altitude, it’s different air! Good, no?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It’s the best! I wish I could live here!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“This is actually where I grew up, my younger years.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Really? But how…” the million and accruing questions returning to Mali.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“We’ll talk later and I’ll tell you the story. Let’s go in?” she reached gently for Mali’s upper arm to coax $er in the direction.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The ‘restaurant’ was a two tiered modern looking wooden building, the top of which was open aired by the grace of large windows that opened upward and latched at the eaves. The top floor cantilevered out from the hill from the long driveway they had traveled, rooted back in the direction of the parking area.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat led Mali onto the walkway to the restaurant, followed by Kwan. As they neared, a jolly woman with a huge smile came down to meet them. Mali recognized her as the same woman in the photo with Cat, who $he had assumed was her mom. “Welcome to our home,” she greeted in accented but perfect English.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Mali tripped over the _home_ vs _restaurant_ question, Cat broke in.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, this is my mother, Bow. Mom, this is Mali, who I told you about.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After the formality of a wai - Cat gracefully and Mali in attempt - and a smile to Cat’s mother, Cat looked at Mali to explain, “Like I said, I grew up here when young. In fact this property is where my mother grew up and actually her and my father met. His family’s land was a few parcels over,” she continued, a little quieter as if just for Mali, “We were dirt poor. Well, aside from what they could produce. I remember a bit as a child. Different life for sure. And could have been for me too.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As they started walking up the stairs and in to the building, Cat continued, “When my father discovered that grapes for wine could be cultivated here, everything changed. For them, for us. Actually for Thailand. We were the first winery that we know of in the kingdom. I was just a child. It was like over a year or two we went as you say ‘from rags to riches’, Cat laughed, remembering something, “You know the fairytale books and Disney? I thought they were simply true and that they happened for everyone - because it seemed to be happening for me in reality as I grew up!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali raised $er eyebrows. It was an amazing thought and synchrony to have as a child. Maybe that was one reason Cat was a person who seemed like there was no limit or ceiling to anything.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But the thing is, I hope you will see in my family, it never went to our heads particularly. Well, except for me, just a little, and my dad with his Hong Kong Mercedes” $he winked her signature, at which Mali quietly snorted, the fact those were the exact words in $er head this morning at the bus station when $he first saw the car.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, please come in and have a seat, the best table is over here for you,” Bow urged them on, as Cat and Mali had gotten stuck chatting at the entryway. And true to the fairytales, it was a majestic view that made Mali believe in what Cat had just told $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The table was shaded, and really the whole restaurant existed in shade thanks to the long gradually sloped roof overhangs. But due to the elevation, the view was panoramic. Seated at the two person table, Cat and Mali gazed out upon the property, vines, and behind them the road and surrounding countryside. It was another world. It could be Napa or Tuscany. The altitude they had risen to made the air and environment, at least to Mali, a much happier place. If it was up to $er, $he would live here over Chiang Rai or Bangkok.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Menu’s arrived. One page, on rustic paper. Very classy. What caught Mali’s attention was it all looked healthy. No pork, in fact no meat or animal products aside from dairy.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“All the food here is organic, vegetarian and grown in this area… we don't bring anything in. Even the eggs and cheese.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Wow, I’m not only impressed but this is like the perfect food for me!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I thought you’d approve,” Cat smiled. They had discussed food and diet at length on one of their Skype calls. They’d both admitted the tendency toward being vegetarian but neither had succeeded yet.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Soon they both ordered, and once the food came, the simplicity and deliciousness at par with the whole of the restaurant experience, they sat, savored and spoke of Cat’s family, past and this amazing land. What Mali already knew of the kingdom of Thailand, temples, golden fluted roofs, rustic and modern aesthetic beauty had extended exponentially.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To something real._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To something…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I feel included in…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Through lunch, Mali fell into a kind of relaxation and surrender that $he did not have so often. Just when the body really lets go, even becoming sleepy. The dry warmth of the day did not hurt either. It was comforting like a nice summer afternoon in a temperate climate, like where $he grew up.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As they finished and continued to sit and chat, Cat looked over and saw this and smiled. Almost not wanting to break the mood but as well having so much $he wanted to share with Mali, now that they were here and in person, she broke in, “So are you ready for the next part of the tour?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well off course,” Mali drawled and smiled lazily.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Great,” Cat replied as she stood, Mali following. Turning toward the inner part of the restaurant building, through glass doors, an intense black shine caught Mali’s eye. A pristine upright piano, the sight of which anywhere made Mali drool to feel its keys. As if they were vanilla-chocolate, and the sound was probably like the rest of the current environment, $he thought, imagining it to be transparent, crisp, warm and true.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat caught $er staring. “Do you play?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, I just do what I do. I am not formally trained but I love the piano. It gets to my heart.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat arched her eyebrows, “Really. Well come.” She opened the door and led $er into the inner room which was really the internal dining room and bar, right now empty and with a nice coolness complimenting the shaded illumination of the windows which surrounded it on two sides.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat looked at Mali, “I want to hear,” she smiled.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay,” Mali smiled back, excited to share this with $er but as always insecure as although most people felt something when $he played, who knows what Cat would think, and it mattered what she thought. Aside from fantasy, music was the place that could exist and be created of the longings in $er heart. If a girl didn’t 'get' $er playing… it was a total turn-off historically.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he pulled out the bench and sat down, Cat joined $er at the edge, “Is this okay?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“More than okay,” Mali smiled back. Everything felt just like home.
