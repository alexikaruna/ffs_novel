**KO:** Well?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Well??!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali stared back at the computer, not realizing how much time had passed, and almost in perfect response to $er own disorientation, another message from K...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Well???

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Sorry, got distracted ;(

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** You were always the spacey kind weren’t you?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Yeah yeah

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Its been years, what the heck, how are you? Where are you? After that night at the DC it was like pretty soon after you vanished and not long after, my company lost the contract. It was all a little mysterious I was thinking. And then I had that dream a couple weeks ago. Hence my stalker activity to find you.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** You’re anyone to talk about mysterious, beautiful woman in black on a motorcycle. The entire cast of Night Rider rolled into one :)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Aw Mali if you were only a girl._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** So, well, I'm in Thailand now. Chiang Rai.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Something in K’s mind crystalized as if it had just solved a big puzzle from the depths of the unconscious,

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Jesus. OMG. Dont tell me, you’re trans???!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** WTF?!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Come on, ‘guys’ in IT there is like 50/50 that they are trans. And for girls like me, its 75/25 they like girls or are at least bi, and the rest, well they are probably just not very good at IT… bwahhahhah… evil aren’t I?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** I must sound totally brash but reality is, to do this kind of work you are better at if if you can quickly enter and leave other possible realities. A flexible mind. You get it from having to break yourself out of the matrix. As well, code and debugging stuff, you have to imagine what ‘might be’ behind things based on everything you already know about systems and code and based on imagining what you don't know for sure but suspect. On a daily and often hourly basis we must throw away everything we know and see with new eyes. Now tell me, what do trans people have to do their whole lives until they wake up?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** But Jesus… you’re in Thailand, the trans capital of the world, and you’re not on the freakin beach, far from it. And you’ve changed your name what I would say increasingly toward the center if not feminine. Reality speaks dude… uh… dudette ! The only thing you could up it with is being in Chiang Mai than Chiang Rai.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Uh, Chiang Mai was last year.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smirked. This was fun.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** OMFG you are soooooo too trans!!!! Because the only other would be you’re a desperate old white guy looking for a 20 something GF. And you’re not old enough, too good looking and too much going for you to be that lame. And if you were I’d personally come over there and beat the crap out of you til you woke up :)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** I am. I’m here looking for a Thai bride.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** You just want me to come there to rough you up.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** So sue me. I’ve a thing for strong women :)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

K’s heart skipped a beat. She knew who she was but it felt good to hear. And for some reason it meant more coming from Mark… Mali. And she’d not admit it to herself but her feelings for Mark were always different. She’d rationalized like a close friend or sibling. But it was this combination of being seen for her strength but also as a human with feelings, few people came being able to get both in the same package.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or maybe I’m choosing women who just want the image. Just want the dream. And then when they realize I come with emotions and needs too… well and my geek obsessions... downhill._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Um, you know its so weird but I needed to talk to someone and you popped into my mind. It was without thinking.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** You’re good at that - not thinking that is hahahah… but seriously, your best gifts are not just your mind, you know that, right? I can see that because I see how we’re different.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Yeah, thats why I need you. I need someone with a brain, a logical brain because I’m kind of fucking myself lately :(

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Fucking yourself???! Do tell???

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Not in the good way

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** I have too much data in my system to sort through. I know I could intuitively make choices, and of course thats how I got here already and…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Are you okay?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** So to speak, I think. But I’m coming to the end of my rope it feels. I’m really conflicted and can’t break it. Gosh, what the heck am I writing, as if you were a psychologist!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** You have no idea how you helped me that fateful night. Someday I’ll tell you. I’d prefer it to be in person, though. And I would also prefer to see you happy when you do come. You were never happy in San Diego were you?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** I tried. There was so much good but no, I was conflicted there too. Much worse. Just an earlier incarnation of whats going on now. Shit, barely had anyone in my life since then. Things have gotten better but I feel like a rice farmer.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They had spend the past hour reacquainting along with Mali detailing $er life and decisions since San Diego... and now it was K's analysis which was coming to the front...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Remember one thing, whats inside of you is you. What you 'feel like doing' is you. I sometimes think most of the problems in humanity is that we think we can change certain things. But we cant.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** People, culture, our upbringings, society if you’re at all different try to fuck you into destroying yourself. Or compromising your integrity to fit in.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** So we live in a world with so much free will and power, but at the end of the day whats in you is like ROM, hard coded shit. And if you’re rooted your rooted and it can affect the hardware level no matter how many reinstalls and patches you try, if the hard circuits are mutated or rearranged, thats how they stay. I think thats where the pain is: When we fight the hardware.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Fucked up shit tries to tell us that we can change things… how we feel, what&nbsp; - who - we want sexually. Gender too. Goddamn religions.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** You know what is known so far about being trans? Its hardware baby, put on track by hormones, a long long time ago, en utero, before you were born.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** It’s not going away.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** We can hack around it… maybe I can help you with that. Maybe that's just what you need. I mean, I don’t want to presume anything only that its not right for you to be twisted up, conflicted, unhappy and so desssssppperattttee that you log on to a private chat server that you have not said boo to in years…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** I am sorry I lost contact. I actually thought maybe you hated me for what happened with the contract and all that.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Yeah, as if my world depended on the income from that! No, not at all. Heck it was Dell servers running .NET and Sql Server and that albatross of code you called an app. You think it made me sad to not have to respond to that anymore? Come on… I’m the best UNIX sysadmin anywhere south of LA.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Won’t argue with any of that. But you do remember that IQ’s drop crossing the north county line, right?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Jesus fucking yeah… ya know, I’d interviewed in SV and in LA but you know… what do you gain by joining that insanity when I have everything I want and need here in the desert?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali was alluding to their inside joke of long ago that "'ok' in Silicon Valley, kinda smart in LA, makes you a veritable genius in San Diego". They'd never pinned it down but to date but their working theory had something to do with the North County-Orange County line and a compulsory drop of IQ upon crossing it in the southern direction. The problem was minimal for those like Mali or certainly K who had a good level of intelligence to start. But to others the drop could take someone boarderline into being a breathtaking moron, as evidenced on the Pacific Beach boardwalk. An extra IQ hit was awarded it seemed to college age and especially those associated with fraternities in San Diego colleges. And douches.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** So I said no and now I contract for both companies up there for about three times what they’d have paid me as an employee hourly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Something was so fun and easy with this chat and Mali was enjoying it. Didn’t hurt that $he thought a lot of K and was simply elated to be talking like this with her.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Speaking of low IQ’s, are you going to tell me whats going on?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Ok, so yeah, I am trans I think. But not a normal one.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Oh, that’s funny, not a normal trans…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** I ever tell you I’m not sure I’m a normal lesbian?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Point taken. In a nutshell I fought it for many years. On and off, like binging and purging. Buying clothes, dressing then at some point getting rid of it all, going back to military workouts and trying to be a man….&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Hoping for the woman of my dreams. In fact I just did it once more here and it almost killed me inside.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** You and the Crossfit workouts. You know they actually just made you look super gay???! I mean here you are this slender thing and then you put on all that muscle? Oh, and waxed. Like some runway FEMALE model taking steroids. She would look gay too :)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Geez, you should have told me!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** I didn’t know… maybe you WERE gay?! Uh, I would’ve had no problem with that! I didn’t know, I mean, aside from your body that screams female energy… but that could have been anything… and if I remember correctly it was I who came out to you during that time. Not that I intended that either.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Well, I am then coming out half way to you now… It’s weird, I needed to talk to someone. Maybe you can help me some.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** I’ve an idea I might be able. I’ll just have to tell my GF why I am sitting here on chat so late at night.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Sounds like someone is pussy-whipped to me… like you need excuses for sitting at a terminal like 20 hours a day… you still doing that, BTW?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Long story. On kind of a leash. But yeah… on the hours…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** If I were you my body would be sooooo angry!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Well, if I were you my brain would be pissed… or what would be left of it after the normalizing lobotomy bwahahahahaa!!!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** You’re sooooo mean, you think I am stupid. Remember my friend which of us is sitting south of the north county border right now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Oh no I am sorry. I didn’t make you cry, did I?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Not telling.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Ok so whats the problem then, so you like women’s clothes, feel like a girl inside? Do you feel like a man at all, or ever? I mean, I'm not now intending to make any fun of you, but that night you hugged me, you were soft like a girl. If I had my eyes closed... God, it felt that good. You have no idea how high on the rebound list you actually were… as a guy hahaha! Of course I would never have told you that then. But now, maybe that helps.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** More than you imagine. I just had this similar experience here.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** The ‘woman of your dreams’ one??? Spill it Mali…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And so Mali and K chatted away for another an hour about the situation with Cat and how it had turned out.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** So I ask you again, what’s the problem?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Look, there is a lot I could say. I am not like the trans women who go ‘I knew I was a girl from as far back as I remember’. I am more like, from as far back as I remember my body felt feminine... enjoyed it, felt soft, enjoyed being soft, of course super sensitive, longed for love intimacy, hated sports. But it was like I never questioned if I could be a girl. I did not know it was a possibility. Even so, I didn’t fit a box anyway. But the horrible thing is, I always liked girls, women still are the most beautiful to me. But its like, to have that I felt like - kind of still feel - I have to be a guy. To have the love, and still to have the relationship I've dreamed of, that by being and following what my body tells me more and more I am, the less chance of having any of it. I feel like I'm throwing away the only chance I have at the deepest dream and longing I have.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** So I feel fucked. I can follow my body and be myself and be seen as gay maybe and drive away any woman who would want me. Or I can try to keep being a guy. Which BTW isn’t going so well…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** I don’t know if you realize that your words have your answer. But you cant see it. Literally.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** What, that I should just accept myself and hope for the best? I’m just not a flaming gay man, I can’t handle living and being seen as something I feel totally distant from.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** No shit. You’re a freakin lesbian. Admit it, NOW. Forget about trans, that’s just a path, but not your romantic and sexual identity.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Sometimes I like transwomen who still have… original equipment though :)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** And your point is what? You ever been with a guy?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Tried once or twice. Nice people, but was not a turn on. Felt nothing or worse, icky.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** But you’ve been with a transwoman?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** The first and only time I’ve had breathless sex. It was amazing. After - and she had penetrated me - I felt so good, so myself. But she was hot, I mean more woman than many women.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** And after, what happened… ah let me guess, you repressed it?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Kinda sorta

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Unbefuckinglievable

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was a pause and Mali waited for more.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** So you’re one of us. Accept it. Fucking a beautiful woman who happens to have a penis… Shit I might do that too. Still feeling pretty gay myself here…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Just sayin…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** I wish I was. But I look like a guy, my upper body. I am not going to be a man with breasts and I am sick of everyone assuming I am gay or like guys. What lesbian woman would go for me?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Well, we can work with the first, for the second, you can guess how I feel about that too. So don’t even consider it a problem. Its their problem not yours. Take it from me - and heck from Cat, you’ve got the special sauce. Oh and lastly, why do you despise yourself so much not to believe yourself lovable AND being yourself?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Its just that lesbian women, they would not be into me. They’re not.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Is that for you to decide? Or have you decided for yourself to shut off from this world so you can stay miserable and isolated, running to a terminal girl for help from the middle of nowhere.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Uh…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But K’s words were still coming.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** In fact I have a friend who would be totally into you. But you’d have to jump some hoops not the least of getting over your fear of motorcycles and anything bigger than a 3 foot wave!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** How do you know that?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Come on, give me some credit… geez… girls talk!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Damn, so some girl was laughing her ass off. I know, it took me freakin six months to catch my first wave, out there every day. I love the water but waves scared the hell out of me. Still anything over 4 feet and I ditch my board and dive.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** You’re a peril to surfers everywhere and an apparent Pacific Beach legend… in fact two, the one in your own mind and the one that everyone saw ;) That said, my GF is calling me, for reals. Can we chat later or tomorrow?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Sure, I’d really like that. And thank you, I'll probably read over this, you said some things for me to think about.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** I hope so. Just know, I'm here for you if you need me. God knows I’ve been through it too and had help when I needed it. I accepted and came out in HS, pre-Ellen days you know… in a way like being transgender is now…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It seemed like K had gone and Mali was not ready yet to let go. But then a true final message echoed to $er console:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** FWIW, open-soul? I knew it was you. That dream. You know how you know who people and things are in dreams even if they look different, right? Well, open-soul was you, I knew it. But she was female. So let that stew yer noodles…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then the dreaded words:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

SESSION TERMINATED BY HOST.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
