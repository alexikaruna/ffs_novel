Koona was not home when Cat arrived around 9pm. She had not answered Cat’s insistent calls. Coming to her house… Cat felt desperate. And now, Koona’s absence brought up a whole other world of unsavory thoughts.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What if I’ve lost her?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I understand why she might never want to see me again._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe she has another woman.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_She’s probably been dating while we’ve been hanging out.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe I never even had her._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Duh._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_She’s gorgeous. Why wouldn’t she be? She could have any woman $he wanted._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As she had watched Koona storm away, even in all the mixed emotion, all she saw was an amazing, beautiful, incredibly strong woman. And the one she loved. It was clear then but over the last days with Koona clearly not wanting any contact, she’d had a chance to marinate and magnify the problem.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Her heart yearned to be in Koona’s company again.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

On the street and during the day she felt her confidence back and stronger, feeling Koona with her despite her absence. But it was not the old Japanese confidence.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe Cat 2.0 too.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She smiled at the thought…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat whose girlfriend is Koona.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_She’s not here._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_She's not yours_!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona. Who is stronger than anyone she knew, beautiful, not to mention the best friend in the world. Just remembering their time together recently, remembering the feeling, made her feel alive, connected, sure of herself and loved.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Which was all so ironic since the object of all this, Koona, was completely MIA. But it had not been long enough for despair, only for an extreme feeling of jeopardy.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Hence this stalking._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smirked halfheartedly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She slunk down to sitting on the wooden floor next to Koona’s door with her knees up, listening to the murmur of the klong, feeling the peace of this place that Koona had chosen and created, even in the eye of this storm.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Koona’s place._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The place and woman that had started to further unravel her bit by bit, so amazing this hidden feeling and power Koona had latent over her even after so many years of friendship.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then Koona’s final blow breaking apart forever the charade her life had been.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Strangely too, on the street, in the mall, Cat had started to look at women differently. And she finally felt a certain peace with men that she’d never had either.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_They are who they are._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_They’re okay.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But not what I want._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_At all._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What are you doing here?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Am I dreaming? Where am I?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona’s voice. Words. Boots with jeans tucked in.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat’s eyes opened to the accusing Koona standing in front of her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat looked up, feeling anxious as she smiled slightly.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I just need to say some things to you, okay? You would not answer your phone”, then adding, “I was worried too and I’m glad you’re alright.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona huffed a breath and raised her eyebrows, waiting. She still felt upset about the whole thing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Okay Cat, lets hear it, here and now. On the porch.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not just all the shit but that damn Tom and Dee comment too. What the fuck_!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In Koona’s heart she’d convinced herself that the bullshit Tom-Dee role based crap was a deal-breaker and because Cat was Thai, and regardless of how close they were as friends, this would be enough to let this go.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Let Cat go._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Eventually._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She had not even gone out with the Flavor of the Month since that night. She had been hurting too...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fucking again. Seven times not going out._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But Cat did not need to know this.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Uh, I actually have a date tonight”, she could not help herself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But it was actually true.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not that I couldn’t cancel.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But she doesn’t need to know that either._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay, fine. You don’t want to talk to me. Fine.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat’s heart was breaking and through the anger the wave of tears could not be withheld, as she stood, in beginning sobs and readied to go.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And then, standing, she was eye to eye with Koona, well, as close as they could be given Koona was a bit taller always, but the boots added some more. Their eyes locked, both transmitting and beholding something deep and a question. Everything she had prepared to say went out the window as well as the charade. She reached her arms out softly and tentatively for Koona. There was no pride, nothing mattered anymore. But the lump and tears in her throat would not allow her to vocalize.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I love you Koona”, simultaneously as the flood of tears broke, but there was no sound, only air.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona furrowed her eyebrows just slightly, in feeling and compassion. She had no idea what Cat was saying but she felt it. It was sincere. Cat was not one break down easily.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat with that fucking precision engineered Japanese teflon surface, around anything deeper than friendship.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What?” she asked futilely as Cat blubbered, loosely holding to her.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Fuck. She was far from made of stone. She reached up and took Cat’s hand and led her to the door, unlocking it and leading her into the bubble of comfort of her simple home.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat had slowed and calmed down now with a cup of warm tea in her hand. She took a deep breath.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That’s better”, Koona smiled. She was still feeling standoffish but obviously Cat had something to say. And regardless, the pesky feeling of hope was rearing its head again.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So now, tell me, what’s up, what are you doing sleeping on my doorstep this evening?” the added smirk putting Cat at ease enough to speak finally.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Koona, there’s more I didn’t tell you, about when I was with Mali”, starting to feel again emotion welling up in her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Do I need to hear this?” the name Mali once again set her off. She did not want to know more if it meant more confusion and drama. Clearly between Mali and Cat there was plenty enough without her involved.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Koona, I just need to tell you, okay, then I’ll go, okay?” Cat paused, “I don’t expect anything…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona nodded.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“The thing is… is…” Cat trailed off, awaiting the courage, “Koona, even when I started to get close to Mali, as a friend, I kept thinking of, remembering you. It was weird, like flashes.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona nodded and raised her eyebrows.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, we were best friends forever, that’s not so weird I think. He - she - kind of took my place, huh?” she pondered the latent jealousy that had lurked behind the scene since their re-encounter, “You know, it really kind of hurt me when you told me about your new friendship… with me by the wayside.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded. That was true. But she had more to say and had to get it out… then she could go back and try to pick up the shattered pieces all around - like this one.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Koona, when Mali and I were together - you know?” she couldn’t say it directly, it now felt like cheating on who she really loved deep down, “I kept seeing you. Not just you. Well, not seeing, feeling. Your body. Oh, it’s so confusing to explain. It was not Mali, I felt you with me. I wanted you with me. Not a best friend. Much much more. Feelings for you… About… you…” she paused, “I know, I’m not making any sense”.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Tears continued, now spilling silently from her eyes but hers and Koona's eyes were now locked. And neither broke it for more than a blink. Just the flicker of their inner movement, contained emotion and questions all in one. In minutes, hours, whatever it was, Cat opened her arms and Koona held her. Heaven again.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I couldn’t understand it. Quite reach it.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And now?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I…” as the words failed her, she raised her head to tentatively plant a kiss on her best friends lips. Koona against the impulse to open, recoiled, not releasing her touch on Cat’s arms but now holding her at distance.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The act of which broke the dam in Cat. The deeply withheld longing, that had finally broken to the surface in recent days was still withheld from its object. Now not just the tears in her eyes but those in her heart started to flow. All that held back for so long. Freed by the most unbelievable. She felt both tortured and liberated in the same convulsive tears.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona raised her eyebrows. She gently but firmly kneaded Cat’s arm under her grip. She was not made of stone. But this was just too soon, no matter how much she wanted it too. She had to take care of and love herself more. Cats track record was not so good and she needed to be sure.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cat, talk to me. I’m listening but I don’t want to be another whim of yours.” The words both evoking opening and splintering in Cat’s heart, Cat felt herself bleed. She knew she had more to say, and she sobered herself.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Koona, at the pool, in my heart, in my dreams, the other night when I told you you’re beautiful, it’s like I’m not controlling anything, I’m just really being true. The rest of my life feels like such a fraud now in contrast. And Mali… without Mali I don’t know if this would have broken through or so soon. I already talked to Mali, yesterday. We’re okay... well, not okay, but they know, we talked. And you know the crazy thing, is it took her to get past all my screwed up boxes I’ve put around myself that I mistook for reality.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat looked at Koona who nodded and seemed to be waiting for more.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

At that moment the doorbell rang. Cat’s heart sunk. Koona knew it was her date. The whole thing was kind of breaking her heart now too. That week ‘together’ had been so nice. She missed it too. But something in her made her continue.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cat, I’m sorry, I really need to go. Maybe we can continue this, uh, sometime soon. Because, this isn’t a five minute conversation, and I had made plans.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m a fucking ice queen too, by the way._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But she could not do it any other way.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Do you want to hang out here? I mean, I won’t be late. We can talk then.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona smiled and made sure to meet Cat’s eyes fully. As if to say ‘get it, I’m testing you, I want more so don’t go’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“She’s someone I’ve been seeing on and off a few months, we’re also friends. I owe her better than to bow out.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Liar liar pants on fire. Flavor of the month.&nbsp;_If that.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But standing plans _were_ still plans. Something in her knew this was okay. If Cat wanted to stay - heck, if she did stay - that itself also meant a lot. And a twinge of jeopardy surfaced in her, in the hopes that Cat would be there when she got home. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If Cat only knew the place she had in her heart.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She could wait a few hours.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And Cat, as the door slammed shut, smiled, that at least… she’d see Koona again soon. And that implicitly it meant this other woman wasn’t such a big deal. Or at least she wasn’t sleeping with her… well, probably not tonight?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Well they could still sleep together._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But that would be weird._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not Koona’s style at all I think._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Shut up Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_You’re going to make yourself insane._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or if so it isn’t love, not if she’s coming back to me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus, Cat, stop!&nbsp;_
