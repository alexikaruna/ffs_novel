Mali knew $er flow and inspiration were coming to an end. Timing was timing and $he knew to listen and respect it. $he eased off the last resolving chord on legato and looked over to Cat. Who simultaneously opened her eyes and smiled.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That was amazing.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then out of the corner of $er eye, Mali was shocked. Inclining toward Cat’s ear, “Oh shit, look around!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The room was almost full of diners. They had not been alone for who knows how long. That was a first for a generally hyper-aware Mali.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

From nowhere Cat’s mother was at their side, “Mali, we want to hire you. Really. Everyone love your playing.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mom, Mali lives in Chiang Rai.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So, he can move here!”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The ‘he’ hit Mali’s heart but $he sucked it up.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How is Cat’s family supposed to know… if she nor I really do either?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus Mali._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

English sucks shit with it’s built in ability to shame. Even when unintended. And too, English was not Cat’s mothers native tongue, so $he let it go.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat looked at $er mother and then to Mali, “So you want to go on the tour still?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded and smiled.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat spoke in Thai just to get Bow off Mali’s back,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mom, we’ll talk about it, okay?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She knew her mother could come on strong at times.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In that moment Bow was called to respond to another group of arriving diners.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali turned to Cat as she led the way just a step ahead, “sorry, I got carried away… this is a beautiful piano and such a beautiful place, I could not help myself.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You think you need to apologize to anyone?!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So you’re mom wants to hire me, huh?” Mali smirked.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It would seem to be the case,” she winked shaking her head.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali actually hoped Bow was serious. Of course $er motives would be all twisted... would accepting to come here to work be for the music or just because $he felt this family was surrounded in light and $he wanted more of it?&nbsp;

A few minutes later Cat led Mali from the restaurant, back the way they had came. The patrons unobtrusively watched and smiled. Many of them were regulars or those who knew the family. Who knew Cat. And _that_ Cat did not lead men around, or even really accompany them for that matter, except for in the most formal and rigid etiquette. It was like she was leading a girl-friend more than a man but that was lost for the most part on the people there.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They saw ‘his’ feminine physique, but many Thai men as well were pretty, gosh, with virtually female faces, which of course Mali would die for. Slender bodies too. They did not see ‘his’ makeup or jewelry. All they saw was ‘his’ back while 'he' played then being led out by Cat.

When they had made it up the driveway, past the little rustic parking area, they turned to the left onto a path which was almost a tunnel created by trees. Light came through but it was shady and relatively cool. Cat turned, smiling and said “I could not say it in front of my mom, but that was beyond amazing! Your playing was like it was from another world. It made me feel so happy and calm. I wish I could listen to you play everyday!”.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s heart skipped a beat. What was she saying? No, it was just a compliment, he had received many from women especially as for some reason they could feel and appreciate $er playing more, and no, they were just sweet people, friends but it meant nothing else, historically. Although somewhere inside $he felt what $he played was a message encoded for someone, intended and impulsed for _the one._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That’s who I play for. Only her ultimately._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That means a lot to me. I don’t play much anymore, and when I do I not only miss it but feel I should be playing more…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Not just something, Mali. It made me wonder whats under all this, inside you,” she whispered just a little lower tone and huskily, gesturing at Mali’s appearance. “I mean, oh, I don’t know…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was the first time Mali had ever seen Cat with even a slight tumble over her words.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I mean, what else are you so good at?”, she stumbled, twitching her head as if shaking off those words, “No, that’s not it. I mean, I don’t know, do you feel… uh, what do you feel when you play? Do you feel like I felt when I listened?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“How did you feel when you listened?” Mali chuckled.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was in a corner, betrayed by her own words.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Being true to her name, she gestured “Come on, let’s not just stand here, let me show you the best thing about this place.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled inside and allowed her escape.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“For sure, lead the way,” $he smiled, feeling a warmth inside knowing that at some point, there was a promise of some deeper conversation. Too, of things $he wanted to know like…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What **is** really going on here?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Of course $he could guess where Cat was going with her questions but of course too, it was better to let things come naturally. Especially from someone as special as Cat. Mali as well continued to wonder what else $he didn't know about her special friend.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat led Mali at times reaching for $er hand as if to gently hurry $er along. Like the woman in the dream, ushering $er down a wooded path on a pristine afternoon, the comfort of being in this woman’s hands felt so good.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The trail was at times sparsely covered with young green trees and plants and at other points around a turn, almost dark with old growth. Light green, dark green, white-gray rock gravel path, sunlight that played with them, threatening to heat, even scorch, but never getting the chance as they made it again to a covered part.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The thing was, $he was walking behind Cat, alone. Cat in that dress that perfectly fit her slender, toned form, at some point the heels had been traded for some equally cute shiny white sandals. It did cross $er mind how it would feel to hold and be held by her. It wasn’t sexual. Well, it was. But not in the way that $he’d been programmed to think by $er culture. Or perhaps by the rare spikes of testosterone based desire. Sexual was supposed to be penetrating but $he had no desire to. But to hold and bond. Even as friends. But no, Mali wanted to kiss her. And if $he was honest - to be Cat’s. What she’d dreamed of since $he could remember, being three years old and embracing that pillow, essentially imagining the same thing. Being with and being. One.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“We’re almost there,” Cat announced happily as they came up to a clearing, but one which the trees further up the hill were now was shading from the sun. In the clearing was a white structure. Some might call it a gazebo but it was not the traditional frilly kind of round or hexagonal. It was a rectangle wood structure, all natural wood with small supporting pillars making it almost invisible under the thick lattices of interwoven grape vines, evident with clearly visible purple grapes! The vines had been arranged to cover the back toward the hill as well as the two sides to the right and left, creating abundant shade and leaving the front exposed with a complete view perpendicular to that which they enjoyed from the restaurant, only several hundred feet higher.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What do you think?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali was speechless again. It kept getting better. All this reminded $er of the long drawn out crush $he had had on $er best girl-friend throughout high school and how $er family had owned a property not unlike this. It was uncanny, and too the same unexpressed longing of so many years back. Then as now, never declared. $he simply wanted this with Cat — and this day itself — to never end.&nbsp;Now as if it was also then.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You okay?”, yelled Cat, already inside the structure.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali had spaced out. Coming to, $he hopped up along the last fifteen feet of the path and up the steps to a new paradise.&nbsp;
