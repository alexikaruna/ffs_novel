The wall of 3pm humidity hit $er as $he exited the bronzed glass doors. She hoped $er ‘sample’, was enough as $he had no desire to return there. Ever. After all, $he was doing the responsible thing but truly, $er heart was hardly in it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Was it $er or the clinic that was creepy?, $he wondered, opening $er umbrella to shade $erself from the intense sun on the busy Tanon.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe its both of us put together._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled lopsided about the weirdness.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It had hit $er the moment $he entered the office. Too many rooms, glass offices with white slatted louvers. Unlit portions of hallways. Tinted glass.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As much as there was a shimmery surface on Thailand - both the traditional and the modern, every time $he delved in to learning more about the country where $he lived, especially in the day to day, there was so much under the surface and some of it felt kind of dark… of which $he wanted no part.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Like the massage salons. Infamous. ‘Oil massage’ meant ‘happy ending massage’, or so $he’d learned from second-hand knowledge.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he wondered when $he entered the place, just because of the apparent moral gray area in Thailand if in this clinic females would be made ‘available’ to the male clients to ‘help out’. There were definitely stranger things being done in the country. Why was it that this should come to mind here?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If it did it raised a dilemma. Not that $he would have accepted the help. Just as the feeling $he got when walking by the occasional attractive women in front of the massage parlors. $he’d still fixate involuntarily… on the less girly one, the tomboy, the girl with jeans an a tight t-shirt. $er heart still wandered there. But it would derail quickly… it wasn’t about sex. It was knowing this was all about money. But moreso, knowing that no matter what $he would pay, $he could never ever get what $he wanted there.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even in the peak of $er testosterone days in $er 20’s, it was still more about the longing to bond. Even for a few minutes. Be close. Feel. Be felt. It had been five and counting years since even touching someone…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And then Cat came, throwing kerosene on the fire… that night._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To feel and be held.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Would I pay for it?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Stupid.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Such could never be bought.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As it would mean nothing to the girl but money. There was no ‘happy ending’ that money could buy that would satisfy $er heart.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not even in Thailand. And $he knew that without having to stupidly try.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So was this why it was creepy maybe?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or maybe all sperm banks are creepy?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Whatever it was, it was pinging $er creep-dar red-line and $he didn’t like it. It was actually in good part a fertility clinic.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What is creepy about that?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But it was.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Nevertheless, it was the only sperm bank $he could find in Thailand.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the end the clinic was professional. No optional ‘help’. At least to $er. Not to the ‘farang katoey’.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mr. Mali,” the reception woman called $er. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck English.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck this fucking fuck._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Mr. Mali_ dressed in womens jeans, a tight tank and in makeup, using the _ka_… going to a fucking sperm bank…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now _that_ was creepy.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Mister fucking goddam Mali.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali shook $er head and shrugged ‘oh well’ as $he walked away down the street back to the skytrain, glad just to be away from the awkward situation. $he had seen the Thai movies, even the most passable Thai katoey was called ‘he’ by others, ‘Mr’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But nevertheless._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What came the next morning was not a surprise.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The woman on the line spoke in clipped but clear English, “We need you to come back to clinic, need about ten more times you gave to have complete sample that be preserved.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And so went the ultimatum.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Surely in the past, $er sample would have been normal. Not on hormones, and especially not the slenderizing of $er body, probably borderline anorexia.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A sad tone set in, just slightly conscious. Confirmation and bringing up to front of consciousness that $he was doing things that seemed against $er body. The kind of thing you don’t face until confronted with a medical exam or a blood test.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And $he knew, because when $he did ejaculate in that cup, imagining being in the arms of the Cat-surrogate $he’d created in $er mind, not much came out. And that was about a months worth! $he had created the Cat-surrogate fantasy because it also felt creepy to imagine being with Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But someone like Cat was okay apparently.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Can’t you just preserve what I gave?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No, ka. There is minimum limit. Not viable,” then a pause, “You come back few times, give more?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The truth was too it cost $100 every time $he had to ‘give a sample’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he viscerally could not imagine, visiting that creepy place ten more times nor ejaculating ten more times…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Ever._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I don’t think I can. It exhausts me,” Mali spoke the truth, “Ejaculation, more than once a month drains me.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The language was probably lost on the Thai nurse. But the nurse spoke again,

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But maybe you not need do this?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali would never know if this woman really knew what $he was saying.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But to $erself, $he knew in that moment the truth of those words.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This was not in the cards.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_$er own biological child.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If the truth be told it wasn’t so much true as the fact that $er life situation was just coupled with not liking who and what $he was. $he was in no place with the desire to reproduce in love. There was no desire to reproduce the train-wreck of $er own self and life.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Worse, the concept of $er being a father was abhorrent. To be called ‘dad’. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And everything else was very much in the frontier of possibility.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Too, if anything was in Mali’s sensibilities, they were towards orphanages, foster children, adoption. $he felt for these beings, not just empathy, $he could see potential in people.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_My genes are pretty much fucked anyway_.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was in honesty the furthest thing from $er mind to bring another into this world where $he hardly had dominion over $er own existence after forty-something years.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It made $er sad. Below conscious level, but the fact was, $he had an amazing body, allergies and special diet aside, was very resilient, full of energy and strong. In contrast to so many who had issue after issue but were integrated into life and society in a way that Mali had never known.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And actually got laid more than once every five years._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was all quite sad. Incomprehensible given what $he dreamed of. $he felt like crying when $he ended the call but did not really know why.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sitting in a mall cafe to refresh, $he took the last sip of $er hot chocolate and saw the bottom of the cup, trying to get one more drop of the delicious mixture, even with $er tongue on the side of the cup, in vein as it was truly the bottom. As if this was the last of sweetness, ever.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt lost. Having made the decision of no more trips to the creepy clinic, $he could return to Chiang Rai. But $he was having a visceral aversion to returning.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Everything felt off. The goddam Chinese Tune was still resonating in $er mind, not so much the actual tune but the image-print it had left. An inescapable haunting.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And open-fucking soul._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he _could_ go somewhere else. To get perspective. That was an idea. And however ungrounded it was to run away from your relatively new home in an already foreign land, $he was game at this point. $he felt cornered by life.
