As the Hong Kong black Mercedes entered the city proper, Cat, who had been in a daze watching the scenery and looking just a bit tired, probably just to keep Kwan at bay for the ride, turned across to Mali, “Look, there is my sister’s school, Chiang Mai University!”, she pointed over to the right as they drove by, “Its a nice campus, tranquil and pretty place to enjoy. I wish I could have taken you there today.”

Kwan smiled devilishly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah, well we can make a list, right? Add also to that the monastery you talked about.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh yes! I almost forgot about that,” Cat spoke and thought to herself, that truly both places would be so nice to continue that chat they had started earlier.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I don’t think a monastery is quite appropriate for you two,” Kwan couldn’t help herself but was ignored.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

"So what did you study, anyway?”, Mali had been curious for some time, for some reason there were certain things that never really came up. For that matter, there was still so much $he didn’t know about Cat, as was evidenced in today.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I studied, believe it or not, international business law. Very useful to what I am doing now, don’t you think?”, she paused, “Well, aside from helping my dad on weekends when his own legal counsel refuses to work!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So how did you end up where you are now?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I floated after school. I mean, a Thai woman from a family with some money, that is easy to do,” she paused pensively, “But actually most people would not consider it floating. I went back to Japan to work. In whatever, just because I wanted to.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That’s when you found the Japanese clinic?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, yeah. I got a job at a beauty clinic in Japan, doing more or less what I do now. I met the owner of the clinic and we got along. It was just a nice match. I love greeting people and I love the Japanese way of things, can you tell?,” she made her wink-smile, sitting up ever more in her poised manner, then laughed, “And I wanted to ensure I had access to all the cutting edge beauty treatments… forever… so why would I change? I came back to Thailand a few years ago and helped them open the clinic you see now. So actually, I know I look like the reception but actually I own this one and the other we have in Thailand, in Phuket.”

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Suddenly many things started to make sense to Mali. “Wow, so you really have made it for yourself, I mean you are in something you like and happy doing it? And doing well at it.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah. As well, I get a lot of freedom. I don’t have to be in the clinic when I want to go travel. So it works out, and I still make money even while away!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That sounds wonderful. I am happy for you.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s programming work afforded $er the life of a rock star, so was the inside joke about such between $er and one of $er previous co-workers whom she’d remained internet friends with. Well at least a rock star on a shoestring budget. But that was fine. That $he had freedom of location and often working hours, generally working when $he needed money and it paid well. The only thing is that $he felt like it drove $er into the ground. Unlike Cat in the clinic in something that was affirming to her person, Mali would feel so anxious and tense after hours of programming.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

On one side the work totally absorbed $er, just as solving puzzles and problems absorbs many. But the focus, it was like it disassociated $er from $er body. The same work which sustained $er and made all $he was doing possible, at the same time seemed at odds with $er ever reaching where $he felt $he needed to be as a social person in the world. $he longed for what Cat had - income, ideally $er own company or product, and feeling alive in what $he did - at least for a great part of the time.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was lost in thought when Mali looked over again, as if cuing her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So maybe - now don’t say anything here,” she whispered, “it helps you understand some of the things I said to you when we walked in the park the first time. About how I am. Just a bit different. I’m fine on my own and have no need for certain things that many women are looking for,” the last sentence even more softly. Which Mali read into, hoping it too meant something about their connection.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he sighed internally as $he realized todays time was running out. The car was now in sight of the Kad Suan Kaew mall where $he’d hang out before making way back to the bus station.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As the car pulled into the malls ‘VIP’ carport, Cat looked apologetically with scrunched shoulders, and smiled, “I'm sorry things are cut short. But maybe…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali broke in, “Don’t worry, it was a fantastic time. So much! It’s okay. I’ll see you soon, right?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’ll try to Skype later, if that’s okay?” Cat offered.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Totally.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Wow, there could be more today. Incredible._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well have a nice time at the mall and safe trip home.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You too, and thanks for everything, it was wonderful!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat opened the door and got out, with Mali in tail.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She smiled, “Talk soon.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Perfect," Mali smiled back.
