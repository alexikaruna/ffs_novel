Cat turned over and was on her knees and hands luxuriously in front of $er. And with her what was left of Mali’s inner imaginings of hope as a male, the embodiment of gentle bonding. Penetrating and holding a woman who was soft and viscous. The last part left that held the hope…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Of being released of all this vanity…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It wasn’t about the woman being weak or even that stupid repulsive brand of the ‘helpless female’. Rather, it was the only way $he could conceive of loving as a man. The gentleness of $er partner needing to at least match $er own sensitivity and softness -- requisites for reasons apparently different than why other men sought an ultra-feminine partner.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If that woman existed, she was in front of $er: Cat, the last possibility of liberation from $er apparently twisted up and almost broken soul.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Mali came behind Cat, $he gently reached around and cupped $er small, firm and silky breasts, pulling her upward towards $er, causing a delicious feeling of surrender in Cat, who was actually surprised by the initiative. Mali held her there to $er. $he’d never been harder. Because $he could be here. And to the amazement of both, and thanks to the abundant lubrication that was already seeping down Cat’s inner legs, Mali slipped inside her without even an effort on either part.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali moved gently as there was much more to go to be completely inside and encompassed. Hitting a place of stuck $he moved with a nudge and some urging as Cat moved her hips to accommodate. $he felt the power now $he’d never had. Not to penetrate or dominate, but the power to be with. Such was $er life, to feel powerful depended on another to be with who could feel it back and be soft enough.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he slid into Cat millimeter by millimeter. In a bit, a little out and then further in. Cat was receptive and just felt 'with $er', like everything else with them, what had always been difficult for Mali with other women had become simple and effortless.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You’re so delicious,” Mali sighed as $he fell forward to whisper in Cat’s ear, now confident with enough penetration. $he felt $er chest softly but fully against Cat’s back. They were now super close and enmeshed, “you feel amazing. I love being here with you.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And for a moment it was it’s own kind of heaven, as Mali held Cat and moved so slowly. It gave $er the feeling that $he wasn’t _with_ Cat but wearing her. Diving in closer, not even to be with or possess but to be. To be owned by.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Which felt amazing to Cat too but also the ultimate tease as she longed to clamp down, push Mali back onto the bed and grind on $er. The thought of which felt great to Cat and she smiled, almost with a laugh, as she had never felt this way with another man.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Another man._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But just like the first caress or the first lick of ice cream being the most delicious, the moment was unstable. It could not stay as it was. Something in Mali momentarily deadened in combination with Cat’s perhaps telegraphed longing for stronger contact. The non-physical aspect of being with someone, where it wasn’t just the body, $he - the situation really - responded to and evolved in the connection and harmony, or disharmony of the feelings and thoughts of both involved.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It always seems that way.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If they change I change. Or maybe its me…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Historically Mali would always blame $erself for such changes if it was a decrease in sexual energy. But $he knew better by now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Hold me Mali”, Cat demanded, at which $he arched $er back and raised from all fours to knees, falling back on Mali. $he felt the tremendous connection of the grinding coming to its furthest potential of meeting.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fuck me Mali, okay?” Cat whispered as she held $er close from the back.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Still the perfect combination of intimacy and primal desire, Mali was invigorated. It actually felt good to go harder and a bit faster, with a little slap against Cat’s ass as $he was completely inside her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The primal fucking feeling taking over irresistibly in both of them as they sped up.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But almost at the same time, something in Mali tensed. A puncture actually, and it was bleeding out magic. $er heart recognized it and sank. Crashing upon reality, the past calling $er back.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Like $er last girlfriend.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_“You never fuck me.”_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_“You don’t fuck hard enough…”_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Feeling like a ‘fucking’ object. Being asked and ordered to fuck. And more and harder.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And being criticized when $he didn’t or was deficient.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not enough._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not good enough._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Something was getting lost here with Cat. Despite what felt good, $he did not want to do this ‘fucking’ and then cum. $he just knew that. $he wanted more than that here. It would be so disappointing and incomplete, regardless of how good this felt right now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even though there was part of $er that still wanted to just fuck the shit out of Cat and cum, $he’d been there enough times to know where it led and it was not a happy ending.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was the place where Mali had been wounded over and over doing $er best to be a guy with a woman. Because it all went well - so well, even according to the moans and pleasure of $er lovers up to this point - but this is where Mali held. In earlier years becoming overcharged and needing to slow down or stop to not go over the cliff of orgasm. As what happened after orgasm was always a fatal blow to how $he felt about $er partner, and really, if $he was honest, $erself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What hurt worst was not about $er own satisfaction but that the place $er lover was arriving could never be reached because $he couldn’t bring her all the way there. If $he tried, $he got there way too fast and too soon. And when $he tried to slow down and hold on, $er girlfriend’s energy always fell and $he felt or was made to feel as not enough, not like ‘other guys’. And in turn, Mali’s sexual energy would decline, the part growing flaccid and it would be yet another moment of feeling impotent and inadequate.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It sucked either way. It was in bed too that $he’d dropped - more than once - to the level of cursing god and $er mere existence. Because that’s how it felt.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As then, now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Except with Sarai. The only different time.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because $he was the ‘bottom’ basically there.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat pulled herself away from Mali and pushed $er over backwards, more fully taking charge. The action authentic and innocent but it connected with all this darkness Mali carried.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Of being deficient. Of being fucking groped and pulled on like I’m some sort of object without feelings._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What the fuck are you doing?” escaped $er lips before $he knew what $he was saying.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat had $er pinned and was riding $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like a man and a woman._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was repulsive. The latent aggression from all the aloneness and sadness inside Mali resisted and pushed Cat off $er, separating them physically and emotionally the furthest they had been since meeting for the first time.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he immediately felt afraid and ashamed. $he was not supposed to be like this. In the past $he would suck it up and become passive-aggressive in later days, but now $he seemed to be acting out the feeling in real time.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To embrace or to push away, a double bind $he could never seem to fucking unravel. Or rather, was on the fence over. Still.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As if reading Mali’s emotion, Cat walked to Mali and voraciously pulled $er into her. What was soft in Cat emotionally becoming hard and ferocious.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali resisted and while resisting, Cat pulled and embraced harder, with all her strength.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And in a few moments with increasing intensity from Cat, almost magically, $er body released the fight. Not just the person in the now but all that $he carried forward from the past. $he was being held, even dominantly, and the messages to $er brain were now correct and in alignment with who $he was and what $he needed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Surrendering with the involuntary shudder arching $er pelvis and lower back, $he felt submissive. $he didn’t feel bad about it, angry or hurt. It just felt right.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Is this where Cat's taking me?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Does she know?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All $he could wonder and hope was that Cat wouldn’t relent. $he wanted to cry but was still not sure.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know what’s wrong, Mali,” Cat spoke softly in her lions-hold. She paused slowly, whispering huskily, “It’s okay. I know what you need now. I’m sorry. I got carried away.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Words which resonated as if plucked and pulled out from Mali’s own past, the last time $he felt right sexually. The first and only time. So $he let go and allowed the tears.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat stood with $er and continued to hold her. Not submissive. Steadfast in her hips and pelvis. With dominant fire in her eyes as she locked with Mali’s questioning blue and white through the tears.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was a different Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She nudged $er and walked forward, as Mali backed away to not lose contact until hitting the wall. Pinned. Cat’s arms trapped $er against the hard surface. $he melted further into it…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was a new experience with a genetic woman. Something in Cat’s way made it all okay. Mali felt like $he had come home.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I think this is who you really are, Mali,” Cat smirked, seeing $er shift.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Cat realized the words escaping her own lips she realized too that they needed to be applied to herself as well.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She still did not understand all this, and though it did not feel perfect with Mali, she was ready to follow it. Because too, something here felt more home than anything in the past. Even more than the pure physical desire from a few minutes before.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Something… emotional… felt…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not a Tom though…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Oh fuck it_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As she held Mali in her power-plant against the wall, feeling $er soften, Cat knew something new about herself. That feeling such in the _other_ made her feel good. The _other_ as a reflection of the self she thought she was supposed to be.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The shadow of culture leered as it slunk back into the periphery.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As the moments progressed, the only constant was the force with which Cat kept Mali against the wall.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Pinning $er shoulders back with her elbows, Cat held Mali’s jaw, pulling it to her as she strongly pressed her lips against $ers.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat’s leg pinned between and upward on Mali’s inner thigh, as a hand came down forcing Mali’s hip at the other side against the wall. Between the elbow on the shoulder and hand on $er jaw, the pinned leg and hip, Mali was immobile and felt the surrender run through $er body as Cat’s hand moved to $er pelvis.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Instead of going for the usual girl-handling of $er penis, Cat caught the base of it between her thumb and forefinger, pushing, forcing it downward, a motion maximally erotic for Mali, in turn surrendering further in the arch of $er low back and pelvis as $er parts moved downwards and back. There was no need for any of that pulling, friction or anything, everything good, wet and orgasmic was deep inside.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The fem._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was always how it always felt. But $he’d never gotten to this place with someone. $he could let go now… because everything was easy. The signals to $er brain were right.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat returned to pressing her lips against Mali’s. Mali’s chest relaxed and deflated, ribs loosening and falling as if cascading over $er spine, softer than $he knew they could feel. It didn’t hurt that $er shoulder was still pinned by Cat’s insistent elbow, as if suspending $er body.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he kissed back but in a way $he had never known. Not like an instigator or aggressor but as a responder. Longing for and seeking $er lovers lips back, hoping to entice them further and closer to $er. Cats lips were a silky wet heaven.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat with her fingers was gently massaging in the area of Mali’s testicles, but between them, inside, in the place Mali always had intuitively gone to find and trigger the deepest in $erself, the most explosive and full orgasms. The place that had nothing to do with $er penis. In fact the exact place the entry to a woman’s vagina would be.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Mali surrendered breathless, Cat knew she was on the right track. What was strange is that it felt so good being this way with Mali. She’d never conceived - less actually experienced such intensity and dominance. She too felt strong, powerful even, but desirous and loving at the same time. She was receiving but also giving in a way she’s never known. She’d never even considered the possibility of such a combination…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Feeling so good…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat had been a bit hesitant, after being rough with Mali earlier, but the only thing that felt right was to dominate $er sex and penetrate hard _that place_ in $er. She aggressed and was rewarded as Mali pushed $er head back and moaned.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fuck Cat, don’t stop,” Mali breathed, “Just take me. I love you. Please. Take me all. Make me yours.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The words which which hit Cat’s heart and brought tears to her eyes for some reason she didn’t know.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat sped up her pace and pushed harder on Mali everywhere she had contact. Her own pussy was throbbing and all of the sudden she realized that was being helped by Mali’s hand which had unbeknownst joined her. She looked into Mali’s eyes with that amazing combination of dominance and longing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Cat sped up, Mali increased $er own intensity on her, one finger curved a bit inside, coming and going against her g-spot while $er palm moved in a constant but rhythmic contact massaging her front outer lips and the soft goodness under it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Delicious through her dominance and yet feeling that flutter and release of something deep inside herself that had kept coming back to the surface since the afternoon, Cat could feel herself coming close as Mali’s hand held her, the dichotomy of sexual surrender yet at the same time being strong where she never been before.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The feeling of such overpowered her as the first wave approached. She fingered harder into Mali, with another finger reaching $er anus and kneading into it as she too cupped $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In Cat’s mind all of the sudden they were both the same. Two women.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And she wanted her partner with her as she came over the waterfall.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat could feel Mali clench and $er breath turned ragged as $he alternated resisting and submitting to Cat’s aggression. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fuck,” they both gasped almost in unison.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Energy shot up through Mali’s body. Arching $er back it went up to $er heart, neck and through $er head, sending almost what looked like stars into $er visual field. $er throat releasing, an unintelligible high pitched vocalization belted from $er as $he simultaneously surrendered and clenched everything.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat had lost herself feeling the female body in front of her: Tight hips, soft belly, surrendering at her insistence.&nbsp;And in a moment as she lost control, Mali became Koona, back in time, right there, then when that kiss… could have happened. And all that would have happened after. That scary but exciting feeling on the periphery back then showing itself more fully.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona’s hand and fingers felt like they had loosened up her pussy to just being soft and pliable as multiple fingers now sunk in to her g-spot one last strategic time.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like a submissive dominant bitch. Against my true love…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat felt whole, complete. Amazing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Her sexuality never having been opened this far or wide, and she came, not releasing Mali without one last final thrust of her pelvis as the second wave ran through her. With one last push from Cat, Mali succumbed and slid down the wall to the floor in a sitting position against the wall. Cat, losing her footing staggered backward and fell onto the bed as the back of her legs made contact. Having fallen over the edge, on the other side was this warm feeling that missed its object. And now she knew it wasn’t Mali.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat cried silently, deeply convulsing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She was with Koona now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But Koona was not here and would never be.&nbsp;
