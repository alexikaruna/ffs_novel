_It's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace, and a wound that will never heal.&nbsp;_ — Tom Waits

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The plane banked and dropped in altitude, in the midst of farmlands and green hills, Chiang Rai came into sight. Mali took a spontaneous deep breath. Somehow, regardless of everything of the last day, this felt good. The plane flight and travel gave perspective, as well as distance not only from Cat but from who $he was in Bangkok. $he had already started to become conscious in the last few geographical moves $he’d made in life, that $he was in some sort of process of integration. Moving to a new place allowed $er to see more fully what was $er, and what was simply an artifact of the place $he had lived previously. By moving rather regularly, patterns could be seen that otherwise $he’d have missed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After a smooth landing, the exit from the airplane was down a staircase onto the tarmac outside. Which $he loved. There was something comforting and grounding about this. Something more real than the abstraction of climate controlled jetways to airports which isolated one from feeling what was really there in the new destination.&nbsp;

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It had been late afternoon when Mali completed $er ‘move in’, laid out $er yoga mat and sprawled on the floor in a starfish position, exhausted. The studio apartment had a high sloped ceiling with high windows on one side, and a larger window on the far side near the bathroom. Allowing light in but also regardless of the time of day, keeping a tranquil darkness and cool over the room.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In many places such an apartment might be too dark or unpleasant but here with the heat it was welcome. Relaxingly quiet and still in stark contrast to the soundtrack of Bangkok.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The neighborhood was mostly Thai, working class, normal people. This building being the exception on the street with a combination of Thai and expat, student and professional tenants.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was early evening as $he wandered slowly down the rural Thai road on a mission to find the park near the river $he had been told about but never visited. There were older houses, showing their years, with wooden shuttered windows, complimented by the newer ones with pristinely fenced lots, bricks, stucco, electric gates, and tinted windows, staples in Thai modern architecture.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Both old and new yet distinctively Thai, with their fluted roofs and ornaments, which for some reason reminded $er of an elegant woman’s styled hair, with a knob, bun or chopsticks. Or a cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali shook $er head as if to rid the thought for just even a moment.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was something so poised and feminine to the houses, and to the culture, its love of aesthetics only matched and tempered by its Buddhist heart and amazing smiles. Traditional and modern but all with the Thai mystique. Just like Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he passed a building with a few shops and restaurants. A group of Thai men stared as $he passed by. $he heard the words farang and katoey. And then laughter. Symptomatic of $er experience in Thailand, kind of a divide in $erself as to how $he felt about the people here. Well, especially working class men but also some women.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

On one side, in person $he was always treated quite politely. The polish and the Buddhist kindness that $er heart always wanted to be the _real Thailand._ But then there were these moments, and what felt like a lot of them, which made $er feel frustrated and angry. Like now. Powerless. Because they were passive, indirect yet at the same time hurt deeply.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The fucking laughter. Jesus._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But $he was in a pretty resilient mood, noted the place and to be wary of anyone there and continued on.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he wandered, looked and wondered. $he could own one of those modern houses, no problem. All $he had to do was get serious with work, accept to open the offshore software development company $er current client had been asking about. It was a train of thought that was far from home in $er own soul and passions for work but resurrected in connection with the question of Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had already walked miles ahead with Cat since last night, not to mention at some point having unconsciously ditched $er identity by the wayside.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

These knee-jerk thoughts even in $er own imagination which in theory $he had full control over were a good part of $er felt craziness. Why $he’d need to be a guy, the one to buy a house - or the need to buy a house at all! - and give up what $he was truly passionate about. But $he felt like $he had a choice - be a man and have Cat… or someone like her… or… not.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Such had been $er romantic life to date, whatever there was of it. To live, ruled by whims of feeling, bodily sensation in association with thoughts and senses of things, made $er a very creative person. Which contrasted and conflicted with such mental designs seemingly required to be a man, which always felt like they needed a lot of effort to keep in place. The thing, though, was that such designs seemed prerequisite to the love and bonded connection she ached for with a woman, according to women themselves if they were being honest. The kind of woman $he liked. Love was on top of all and as such, gave power to the fabricated and prescribed man-world construct.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Over the years it was always the same. Periods of _being a man_ in earnest. But inevitably a moment of deep sensation or some serendipitous brush with someone in the world would trigger a flood, like another person, the feminine, coming over $er. It was visceral, physical, sexual but very much more. $he could only describe it as _the way a woman feels in herself.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It would trigger all kinds of havoc, the uncontrollable sexual desires to be penetrated, equally confusing as men never were attractive to $er. And only if $er lover actually saw $er as a woman. It was not right for $er to look like a man and have this. It was not that $he was judgmental about gay men. It was visceral, apart from the mind. $he wanted to surrender as a woman. It wasn’t even about being passive or active. It just didn’t fit how she felt and wanted to be seen by $er partner coupled with how $he appeared in the world ‘as a man’.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It made $er want to get $er body smooth and waxed, wear form fitting clothes, and long and often go deeply into $er own exploration of which for all purposes felt like female sexuality.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And not just sexuality, all the changes, all the higher maintenance stuff of the world of a female. $he did what $he could, bit by bit over time. But never coming close to being treated as a female as default by anyone.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Girlfriends on more than one occasion would innocently comment that $er body, being tall and slender was like a female models. But then $er face. When $he looked in the mirror it may as well be the head of a horse. The deal-breaker since childhood, the trigger shutting down any further consideration. Likely even if given the option of ‘transitioning’ which was a non-existent concept growing up in the 80’s in suburban Silicon Valley.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Back then $he had no idea what _this_ was even, and through late puberty had innocently never considered that $he was any different than other boys. Aside that $he did not relate to them generally and hated sports. So of course, it didn’t enter $er mind that $he had a choice to be a different gender. A girl.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he would hear the comments like _‘body of woman face of man’_ leaving others lips_._ Especially embarrassing when $he was deep in male emulation mode and doing $er best. Another of those passive drive-by angering moments $he felt impotent to do anything about.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What do you fucking say or do? It isn’t said directly to you but you hear it. Fucked by the world if I react, fucked by myself if I don’t._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he’d try to gain weight, do military workouts, but within just weeks $he’d get sick and lose everything $he’d gained, not to mention slip back into the feminine mode because $he secretly liked the more female way about $erself. $he longed more than anything for someone to see $er, recognize and validate what $he truly was. But no one ever did.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With all the changes, in recent years not seeming attractive anymore to anyone, perhaps save for gay men, in whom $he had no interest. So then, would she give up the possibility of a relationship with Cat in exchange for the fem, and in the end be alone, and read as more of a gay man than anything else? To be something that felt seemingly right to $er inside, in spite of the world, at the price of losing what $he wanted most in life externally?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Someone special.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So it was not so much about the house, work or things, but what they symbolized. The intimacy like $he’d had only the previous evening with Cat in the park. A life partnership, together. Equality. $he would do anything for such a relationship. But however $he tried, the person in $er who seemingly could attract that slipped further and further away. Upon $er own body’s insistence. Which had recently led $er to trying female hormones and going on androgen blockers, now that $he was in Thailand and could buy over the counter. Bringing up an even worse problem because $er body seemed to like - no, love - them, and $er small breasts had started to develop.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And it was totally unacceptable to be a man with breasts.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It just was.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But unlike in the past, now contemplating Cat, something in $er hesitated and even pushed back. Even on this day in which she felt so very enamored with Cat. Regardless of not passing as a woman currently. Even to get back to the semblance of a mans body…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It would take a year or two.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Seriously.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Military workouts._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he still saw it, though, an option. What $he always forgot was that even if $he did start progressing back toward masculinity, it only took a few days, a week or two at most to feel fully feminine again. Lose it all. But that was beside the point. The world and even $er face especially seemed to say $he was supposed to fight against this inclination to be female, and so did a good part of $er own heart, it seemed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If nothing else to avoid a lifetime of this bullshit ‘farang-katoey’-like ridicule._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But today, as $he contemplated it, doing this manning up process again was just a house of cards.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Destined to fail.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Because it had.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Over and over.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Empirically.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The accrued pain and hurt of the past actually made $er heart revolt today. The courting, the promises, the falling of the woman for $er, a man, apparently at least. $he felt immediately sad, it made the woman $he purported to love actually be a sucker for a false hope.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he’d never seen it so clearly before.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But could there be something in $er that could unravel this compulsion with being feminine? Some unresolved childhood issue? It was the type of thought, the only one left, really of hope to hold onto. Something too, which when resolved, $he could explain to $er future love, hopefully Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But then again. Being a man. It came with so many anxieties. Would Cat take financial advantage like her ex’es? Would she demand the _he_ fuck her or complain that _he_ didn’t fuck her enough? To fuck $er girlfriend, that way, as a man, it felt like a chore. More than that, it made $er totally anxious.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No win at all. Having to support a woman and then coming home and having to fuck her._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck that!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So in the end it was an unresolved draw. $er heart still longed for such a love. And $he was not anywhere near being seen by anyone as a woman. But just as well, $he was neither able to let go of who $he had become, at best an in-between-gender being. Who $he knew was too thin to be attractive. Clearly off the female radar.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Meaning too, Cat’s radar.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Probably.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just a ‘katoey’ friend._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So having made yet another pass through the contents of $er trunk of despair, coming around the last bend ahead in the physical world in contrast, was paradise to $er eyes. A park, with shade trees, many gazebos, all along a flowing river. On the other side was rural country, houses and hills in the distance.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he knew this would be her new home in the early morning and perhaps too in the evenings, like tonight. $he took a deep breath and released it. Fully conscious that for some time even deep breaths did not have the same feeling as they had in the past.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was something holding $er from full surrender. Ever since taking the ‘going to hell’ path, certain things, just a latent tension or anxiety were ever present. They’d become the norm. She willed and wished to uncover what that was that was doing this.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The clock of life was ticking and this conflict was not going away.&nbsp;
