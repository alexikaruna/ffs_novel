_Porque el vuelo de las aves se parece_  
_Pero el viento que las lleva no es el mismo_  
_"The flight of the birds appear the same but it's not the same wind that carries them."_

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It felt like deja-vu except the past time had been real. As such felt $er life, bordering on the surreal. Just alone, floating around Thailand out on the limbs $he was treading.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And Hua-Hin._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Just one night away from that place and that whole experience already felt like a dream... itself was like an experience from a book…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That someone else wrote._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was dressed in black yoga pants, converses and a black tank top. After the walk over to the park, $he felt strong and powerful, even grounded. The same which of course would erode generally after daybreak as $he walked back home through the growing morning crowd, sidewalk gridlocks and curious or other emotion expressing eyes. Once again the unfortunate part of ‘body in the world’ and soul not feeling as one.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And today - as despair often seemed to do - it made $er feel sultry, want to be fucked, surrender, taken. Not some mental fantasy. The feeling. The feeling that never made sense unless $he was a woman. And that same slippery slope $he’d futilely spent the last several days trying to unravel once again. And in the face of passing men on the street especially this feeling felt uncomfortable.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And the one thing that $he still did not allow $erself the hope to consider - that $he could physically transition, including $er face and even come to embody to the world everything $he felt.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Well, more of it at least._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali shook $er head. $er life was beyond surreal by now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not to mention Cat. No matter how sliced, that was the most surreal of all of it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That she exists.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That they met.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Found a friendship._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That it happened.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fully happened, regardless of how it ended._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The last time here was with a high hope.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This time, $he was simply listless. Almost directionless.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like there’s just nothing I can do or give a shit about at this point that would make any difference.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But Cat had asked $er to come.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Again._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Plus there was a good degree of anger. Cat had made it clear that nothing was promised on that night. $he had agreed. But it still hurt. They had gotten so close leading up to it. And Cat didn’t deny the depth of the experience.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just another time of not being that which the other wants._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But good enough for some passing moments I guess._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he did not hate Cat, but just felt ambivalent, fueled by the anger to destroy something of it, if it were possible. Although $he was also curious what Cat was going to say.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What more could she possibly say than what already?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he would just sit and listen and stare.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he’d hold $erself close now.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That’s the plan.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’ll probably suck at that too.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was now coded as danger in $er system.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But Mali also knew how fast $he seemed to forgive anyone.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he’d look like a rockstar, at least tonight. Not because that is what $he felt but seemed to be what Cat liked, $he’d intuited.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat can eat her fucking heart out.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Then I’ll go.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That was the best possible outcome.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’ve earned a free ‘fuck-you’.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smirked to $erself contemplating $er own psychobabble.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he didn’t care, and in $er mind and heart $he was already thinking of being back in Chiang Rai.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And of a session with $er dildo that $he’d not brought on what was supposed to be a two day trip. Fact was that the fem had come over $er this morning, as it always did when $he’d try for a period to ‘be a guy’ and it was enough in Hua Hin of built-up misery that flipped $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It wasn’t a frilly or foofy feminine feeling. $he’d never in $er life had the desire to to be a ‘sissy’ or put on ruffles or a tutu. Or be demeaned or taken as a ‘less than’. It was a raw sexual feeling that was larger than $he was. It was not even about $er sexual identity as a concept but simply about feeling and expressing something that came as nature.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Secretly inside under the anger $he was hoping for a repeat of that night with Cat. At least an offer of such from her. But too $he knew that even if offered, $er anger would win and $he'd walk away albeit with veiled tears. $he always had in situations like this.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Yeah… integrity and self-respect preserving anger.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Albeit the outcome being a little regret at times…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The time flew on the thirty minute walk to the park in $er own world of thoughts and feelings.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was now in the same place. At the same park. Same lake. Same time. Same blue glowing ‘TMB’ sign. Except that today $he held $er purple and gold hula-hoop in front of $er as $he appreciated the stillness of the pre-dawn.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cause today is fuck you day._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A _fuck you day._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Why in the fuck am I even here? Being Cat’s bitch?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he almost was going to just practice $er standing like normal. But since $he’d missed hooping for the last two days, it felt better to do a hybrid practice - hooping and then whatever else felt right after.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Especially given the pool of emotions and raw desire $he was swimming in.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To Mali hoopdancing really had nothing to do with showing off as others often made it be, or even being seen, although it could feel good if it just happened. $he hadn’t chosen hooping for any reason other than it felt amazing and taught $er things about $er own body no other exercise could.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even on an off-day, it was still the favorite part of $er day. It was more like hoopdance chose $er and $he just kept doing it - because it reinforced itself in feeling.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What $he didn’t realize - and wouldn’t for another year or so, is that hooping was the place in which she’d carved out a daily activity that allowed $er to be totally $erself. Because for $er, being authentic, meant being at one with $er body. And that $he had - even up to today with the problems $he had - had come a tremendous distance. The world was just too spiny to be _that_ all the time in it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

‘Being a guy’ in Hua Hin, even with all the time on $er hands $he had not wanted to hoop. The proscription was authentic from the persona $he’d worn.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Yeah, as if being a guy for me is fucking life affirming…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Growing up she had pinned it as feeling like there’s like a million volts of electricity in her but running through thin wires. Causing gridlock. Those thin wires replacing the flowing and authentic conduit of life energy. Except that $he couldn’t remember ever feeling that original vitality but $he knew it existed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Every day as $he danced with the hoop, it was a day further toward having more authenticity than $he’d ever had previously. Since childhood $he’d been after just this, something no-one had told or taught $er. Standing meditation and hooping themselves also being organic gravitations. It was one of the few things $he ‘just knew’ - $he’d learn from people, teachers but then move on quickly once $he realized they were going in a direction that was not what $he knew to be right for $erself.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Hooping was the apex of the somatic system $he was creating for $erself - and $he hoped, would be applicable to the world. A hoop session was only as good as it could start slow. Connecting to each area - the bottoms of feet, knees, hips and pelvis, lower ribs, shoulders, collarbone, neck and head.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Having gone through the slow, methodical but equally passionate warmup - and it was still to music where $he just disciplined the emotion to work through each of these individual areas, then $he could let go.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And know and be who I really am once more._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not just who $he was today. But always. This place - of embodied expression - was always the same, always true, always the highest. And really had a lot to do with the true reason $he’d ditch pretty much everything else in life - money, power, things - to follow.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was the inner guru some people talk of. It was the conviction to dismiss body workers, martial arts teachers and pretty much all therapists one by one when eventually their guidance did not match this solid reality.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It also helped to be out in public. $he did not understand it fully yet but it was an affirmation of $erself.&nbsp; It was a form of defiance.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With $er iPod shuffle clipped onto a headband, blindfold around $er eyes, $he slowly eased into movement. Not much different than as $he would have eased from standing still into slow motion. As it was in the minute movement and immediate feedback from this higher knowing part of $er brain - the part $he had been courting $er whole life - where the secrets to authenticity resided.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And true, those whispers, the same whispers were those that called her to the fem. Without them $he’d right now be in Mexico probably. In love with a woman and married. With a family probably. It was still heartbreaking the possibility of this other world - of which $he still felt too much like the current was the dark alternative reality $he’d chosen.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Be it as it may, the dark alternative had this. A daily affirmation of life. Dancing with the hoop to music, was the most life affirming thing $he’d ever had, on every level. It compensated in a way for the social and romantic void, the dreams that were getting further and further away on the horizon of possibility in the rear-view mirror.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the past the passion, when it tried to emerge through the physical, would overwhelm $er body. In earlier days it meant being even more tense, head forward and feeling stuck in a defense posture than at the start. Which actually seemed to be a vicious cycle. It meant punching things - both from the caliber of the passion $he had inside but also from the anger and frustration of not feeling ‘at one’ with $erself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or even just okay in the world._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Back then it seemed to have little to do about gender.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It made $er think of - and actually feel - in $er being and reactions - like an angry teenager. Over time $he did start understanding that the gridlock was nothing more than opposing muscles and muscles that should work one at a time were contracting at the same time and then fighting each other to decontract, but the fight actually was making them both more tense. $he wondered if $he communicated this as an educational program if it could help people - people like $er - who feel stuck and at the end of their ropes. Angry people who don’t know why or how to fix it, and feel it in their bodies.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was only $er ex-chiropractor and girlfriend who had started breaking the circuit. But as if some part of $er knew something much wiser, $he found hooping and other methods of working out this problem on $er own, as the boyfriend-girlfriend thing showed to be unsustainable as $he grew.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The hoop was the perfect complement to standing. It speaks. It doesn’t lie about the degree of embodiment, poise and grace one is in and able to attain while one dances with it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_… and listens._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali knew first hand that there was further to go with the hoop. There were things $he saw women do, that $he couldn’t do with the same grace. Because the defense posture was still there. But the hoop was the barometer, and the path. That $he knew.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The curious thing is that blindfolded, as $he generally practiced, $he did not need a mirror to tell $er what needed correcting. The more natural - and often proscribed the movement (for a man) - tended to be exactly what looked best when $he looked in the mirror when the blindfold came off.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was as if $er body could feel a parallel existence and it already knew how good $he could be. Maybe $er body knew $he was a she. If $he had been willing to trust that more and turn off the mind, maybe this all would have come down sooner.
