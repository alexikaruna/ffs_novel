_Just be calm, slow down, take a breath. Try to smile._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali heard echoed back from $erself the inner advice and wisdom $he was coming into especially from observing $er day to day vicissitudes with $erself in the little north Thailand city.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When $he was calm, stood tall and was happy, things went well. Smooth. Almost very good. And $he wanted more of this.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But when I’m not… it’s shocking…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he smiled and laughed to $erself. It was true. Heavenly or simply shocking.&nbsp;It was absolutely true.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And getting overheated, carrying too many things, does not help. Slow down Mali. Take a break when you need one._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That was the advice from inside.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The heat of the day still hung and radiated from the ground as Mali made $er way on the short walk to the Chiang Rai Night Market - the place to see and be seen on a Saturday night. $he’d made several deals with $erself, one of which was not to carry more than a few light bags at most if $he bought anything. Second, to stop places and take breaks before getting overheated. There was an inverse connection between being able to stay poised and ‘$er own person’ with getting physically fatigued or overwhelmed. This had become absolutely and replicably clear.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The third which $he’d done since arriving in Chaing Rai was to fully rest every Saturday. As $he was accustomed each Saturday, $he reflected on the week past, a morph of the Jewish idea of a sabbath.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A week ago tonight I was sitting at dinner with Cat.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt like a different person now. But not in such a good way. $he had grown listless, and day by day over the week, more. Feeling less okay out in the world, more untouchable, and inside seemed to mirror the outside. Today’s rest hadn’t helped like it usually did. It was the kind of feeling of not being at ease or comfortable anywhere in $er own skin, even at home in the most chill and relaxed situation of the day.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he turned into the busier area at the corner with crowded mom and pop restaurants and of course $er favorite refuge, Wawee Coffee on the other side of the street. $he could feel the tension in $er body, especially neck increase and willed to have control over $er poise but it was a struggle.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$er body knew $he was going to be in contact with people.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Many people. Thai people. Often nice, but not infrequently, irreverent.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Passers by. The Night Market crowds.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Regardless of the Photoshop epiphany the week before, $he was still going back and forth on it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And I know although I see it, to have that face requires surgery. Why can’t I just accept myself and my amazing body as in between? Love myself and get on with it?_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It wasn’t like $he was unattractive.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And really, if I smiled more and calmed down, that goes a long way to being more of who I am._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_There are people… women out there… who would get me. Look at all the new age or surfer people… the guys are often so pretty if not feminine…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was true. But so was Mali’s journey and the paradox of how the physical, appearance, hormones coupled with the spiritual, the emotional and life outlook — intimately tied.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

More important than any surgery was the let down of $er defensiveness. In times when $he was able to ‘just be’ and connect with others, $he felt amazing. It was a nice idea but $he could not implement it. As the defensiveness seemed tied to how $he looked, how others seemed to respond to $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How can I possibly let my guard down… when I’m already stared at, laughed and and ridiculed all over the place?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So it was this catch 22 where maybe looking better might fix things. But it seemed the wrong way to do things. The easy way.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then of course, was the almost irresistible allure of the potential change.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But then the cost.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The risk.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And no strong match on a surgeon.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was true, being a man and $erself now more than ever felt like oil and water.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But is it just because of where the world is? Because I can be this way? Choose it? Because that doesn’t make it the right path…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Would I have chosen this if I lived in the past? When things were harder?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I doubt I’d had the balls.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali laughed at $er own inside joke, having realized over the years that the more feminine $he became, the more $he’d ‘grown a pair’.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe I can just let this all go and just be happy, meet the right woman who gets me and loves me and everything will be alright._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Of course also tugging at $er was the ongoing time on hormones. Soon certain things would be irreversible - like sterility and not to mention the manboob problem.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Surfers and new-age guys aren’t taking hormones and getting facial femeninization surgery._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

No comfort there.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Home did not feel comfortable or like home anymore.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The apartment felt like it had bad energy.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had a Skype consultation scheduled with a recommended surgeon in South America, but that was not for a few weeks.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was all up in the air.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Looking out the window earlier that day, at what was in weeks past such a tranquil world now for some reason seemed dark, something subdued, hidden, even malevolent. Even the rooftops with their Thai ornaments and the darkened windows felt like eyes of a world of which Mali was outside. In every possible respect.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he couldn’t concentrate.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he knew from the past that such a state was due to not being able to be present in the moment and feel $er feelings. But nonetheless it was like the whole environment had conspired. Construction had begun on a new building next door. Noise sometimes going into the night. Losing sleep didn’t help. It felt like $he did not own $erself or $er mind anymore.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had tried to get away, to the park, the mall, the little coffee shop by the Clock Tower at the center of town. And now she approached the Night Market, although in $er state it was more with anxiety than true interest.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So in jeans, combat boots and tank top Mali reached the street lined with makeshift booths and ad hoc lights. $he wandered in the flow of the substantial crowd, many young-ish Thai people as well as adults, punctuated by occasional tourists. Flat chested, androgenously dressed, with $er neck, $he wandered in the flow, checking out all the bright, colored or simply beautiful merchandise being sold.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he still grinned and chuckled at the more strange offerings.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus… putting snails of my face as a beauty treatment…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not gonna happen!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he walked slowly, reminding $erself to stay in $er body and not rush, the only possible chance $he had at enjoying the evening at all. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Look at the foreigner…”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Of course this was said in Thai and not meant for Mali’s ears.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Here goes…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Looks good” another young male voice responded behind $er, “thin, pretty.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You think the foreigner is a Tom or Dee?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Hmmm… dresses like a Tom but you know, Dee I think.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yes Dee.” They agreed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali could not help it and turned to the source of the words, a couple cute young Thai — pretty clearly gay — boys quickly turned their heads away and together, Mali catching the embarrassed upturn of their ‘no crying over spilled milk’ smiles. There were twelve or thirteen distinct smiles that a Thai person can identify distinctly without any difficulty, and Mali was starting to be able to see them.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That was the thing with Thailand and it still screwed with $er mind that even if people seemed to be laughing at you it was maybe not really necessarily that, not the same as being laughed at in the USA.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But Mali couldn’t completely tell. They weren’t necessarily being mean spirited. They were just being themselves, in the present, being Thai. There were so many levels of smile and laugher there and they could be as much about the emotions of the person themselves than a criticism of the apparent object.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Nevertheless, such attention activated $er American sensibilities, which was generally the path of a downward spiral towards frustration, anger and feeling ridiculed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This time, though, $he actually smiled.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Hey, at least they get me.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Does that mean they saw me as female?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Is there Tom and Dee for gay men here?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Are they seeing me as female, katoey or gay man???_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he would have done anything in that moment to be fluent in Thai and have Thai friends $he could actually find out the truth from, it would be truly eye opening. But the language aside, the culture tended to put what seemed like a hard barrier between foreigner and Thai.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Tom and Dee were descriptive terms of lesbian women, the closest thing in English being butch or fem, but here they were much more than that.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Regardless, barring further understanding, Mali took it as a compliment.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After another twenty minutes or so, $he was getting hungry and started edging against the general flow of Night Market people over to the street that was all about food. Which of course did not help $er sense of wellbeing, both being hungry and having to try hard to get to where the fulfillment would be.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Feeling $er blood sugar - which was ever volatile as $he was late on a meal due to $er minimalist diet, $he compromised on some fried noodles and sushi. With a plate of food in hand $he spotted a dry fountain area atop some steps where many, especially younger people, were sitting.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Finding a solitary step area, $he sat down but not without noticing the following eyes of a few groups of youngsters. Not unusual, except one boy kept staring. Mali had no mechanism to interpret such attention positively - be it the attention of ridicule or of perhaps gay attraction. $he ignored it and sat down.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It would be nice to connect with someone though.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But $he had no sense or concept of how to do that short of someone approaching $er. As was $er default passive strategy in life to date. Intelligent and even aggressive, in everything but in connecting and meeting others. Not to mention $er seeming inability to prioritize social time if there were opportunities against the somatic excavation project $er body demanded for hours a day.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he kept noticing glances over at $er. Also totally normal in Thailand and in fact anywhere at this point. They exaggerated the pain of loneliness, the form of which was tension in $er body $he felt impotent to handle at the moment. Every time $he heard laughter $he willed $er eyes not to look to make sure it was not about $er. But $he succumbed to the compulsion to check out the situation more often than not.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Another foreigner, an attractive and confident looking black woman sat near $er, a combination which Mali had always found very attractive. Black skin was unusual in Thailand. And too the culture was all about being white. The whiter the better. Evidenced by all the whitening cosmetics and skin bleaches available at every pharmacy.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I wonder how it is for her here._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali willed to talk to her. $er mind coming up with creative remarks, but then sitting on their execution until they became stale. After a few minutes, as the woman came, $he went.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As things were, Mali being who $he felt $he was perceived as, hardly had the spark to even try anymore.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What was the point to even try now?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A breeze had been coming up a bit but it was the first drop of rain that made it conscious. And then a big gust of wind, as if from nowhere. People looked around and many rose immediately. A trickle started but from the strong gusts of wind and the rather quick up and go of most people, what was coming was pretty clear. Mali gathered up $er bags and followed in suit.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Home was ten minutes walk, close, but that could be ten minutes of being soaked with what seemed to be inevitable.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The heavy rain started just as $he was turning off the night market street. Just a patter at first but then another wind came. It was dark, with occasional dim rural street lights illuminating the dampening pavement. A street later, crossing the two-lane bridge into the more residential area, full downpour.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Instead of fighting the rain $he smiled and let $erself feel it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was walking all of the sudden care-free in the warm rain down a dimly lit rural street of a remote town in northern Thailand. The confluence of surreal and real hit $er. A remote nowhere, was a remote somewhere. Who would have imagined $er here? As $he was? $he couldn’t have even comprehended this a year ago.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This is my home.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In a split second was a traversal of the artificial division between outsider and insider, not okay and okay, man and woman, katoey and cis.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I might be nothing to anyone. But I’m someone to me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I chose to feel the rain because I like it.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It felt powerful. To choose to like something because you do. To own your choice.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I like this.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I love these roads. The traditional colorful houses.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This rain.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The peace and tranquility here.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The chill people who I know are all around.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I like what I like.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I like what’s inside of me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

From nowhere the apex of tension in $er throat broke, just like the storm clouds spilling rain and $he began to cry. No one was around and if they were, they could not hear it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Being alive was beautiful. This simplicity, the joy of feeling the rain was so wholesome.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he did not know where the tears were really coming from, but $er body was triggered by the contrast of surrender to everything $he had and was going to put $erself through.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was as if nature had sent some help.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like the black woman at the market. I like her because I do. I don’t care that she’s different._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_In fact… I’d prefer her to be that way._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If I like being a girl then… why should I make that not okay either?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’d be doubting it just as if that beautiful black woman doubted if she was beautiful… just because of the Thai white obsession!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So why not me?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he got home and felt a bit better about things. All alone and unsure of what she was doing, riding the waves tonight.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Almost literally._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Riding the waves. Finally feeling the vortex of forces $he was enmeshed in.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
