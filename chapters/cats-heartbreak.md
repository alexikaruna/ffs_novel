“Koona,” Cat looked searchingly at her friend. The memory had returned and it was like a knife in her side. It would hurt to pull out, but now discovered, it would have to be exorcised.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This would perhaps be the most vulnerable thing she’d ever have to tell someone.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona came over and hugged her.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It’s okay Cat, you can tell me anything. You know that.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded sadly, “I guess since we’re on a roll today, huh?” The level of disclosure between two already close friends had already reached new heights in just a few hours reacquainted and it was just getting started.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona nodded, “I’ve not held anything back from you today, have I?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Spill it._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Your place reminded me of something I forgot. That I just remembered…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona was silent.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m remembering… I don’t know why I forgot. Completely forgot. My tutor…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mr. Takeda?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No, no, tutor actually, to help me after school…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I didn’t know you had had one…. you know, there’s a lot I don’t know about that period of time with you. You never talk about it much.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smirked what looked like almost in pain, then spoke slowly “... maybe this is why…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona raised her eyebrows.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Koona… fuck,” the tears started coming, “fuck.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona put her hand on Cat’s own softly with a firm warmth, “Cat, it’s okay, whatever it is, it’s okay. It’s okay, I’m here, don’t worry.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She held her crying friend again as the minutes ticked by, soothing her with slight movement in her embrace, like a mother helping to rub a wound to make it better.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat raised her eyes to Koona, searching.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Her name was Noriko…” Cat smiled off into the distant past before the injurious moment.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I got hurt. Actually it was double hurt…” it was all coming back now. The feelings, the innocent impulse inside her young self… and then…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona was trying to piece things together. “You were how old when you were there, nine?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Ten. Because I remember that horrible birthday the week after when my parents came to visit,” Cat inhaled deeply as if preparing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Koona, she was young too but older. To me, big. Like fifteen. We spent every afternoon together, you know, because I was new in Japan and there was so much, just the language alone…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona nodded waiting for Cat to continue.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Koona we were playing. We would play…” Cat looked far off for a moment again, “She was… she was cute. Confusing… Cute…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Tell me about her… Noriko.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I didn’t know anything then. She was cute like a boy but she was a girl. I didn’t know what a tomboy was then. Barely knew the difference between boy and girl anyway,” Cat smiled ironically, “she was just… she was just who she was, okay?” Cat adding the question to see if Koona understood.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona nodded. She did. All too well.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“We’d play… ah… in between… uh… we we’re supposed to be studying, you know, right? With our time. In the afternoons.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona had never heard Cat have so much difficulty speaking, for a woman so eloquent in just about everything. She gently placed her hand back on top of Cat’s, and moved gently back and forth in comforting.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat looked directly at Koona, yet not being able to control the tears that would afflict her next words.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So we’d… you know when I’d say something dumb or she’d make me laugh, I’d push her or she’d shove me or something… you know, kind of roughhouse, right?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona nodded.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So one day… we we’re there, alone. Sitting on the bench in the kitchen… working, playing, you know… and… I remember she totally cracked me up about something… who the fuck knows now… but I just shoved her over and… you know, I was a lot smaller. Well…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat started crying fully again as the feelings she’d buried for so long in shame returned.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I never knew what it was how I felt about her. You know… when you’re young… you just… you just feel, right? There’s nothing wrong about anything, you know?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona nodded again.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Oh do I know Cat, you have no idea…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So I succeeded pushing her over and I’m there on top of her… uh kind of… uh… I actually pinned her down you know? And…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona smiled broadly in empathetic joy while Cat gave her a sideways quizzical look.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay, so you pinned her down and???”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat shook her head, “Jesus Koona… I kissed her.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona willed to stifle her surprise and kept quiet.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And then it all happened so fast…” Cat was shaking her head, “It hurt so much. She pushed me away. Hard. Like she hated me… and then…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona interlocked fingers with Cat’s hand, “Then we weren’t alone. Mr. Takeda had arrived. He saw the whole thing… you know, like from the start…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat shook her head almost in unison with Koona’s empathetic disbelief. She started sobbing again…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Koona, I never knew what shame was. You know, in Thailand we have our stuff. But there… in Japan… Kyoto… I’m alone, away from home, my parents… cared for by Mr. Takeda and his family as if he was my own father…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona continued shaking her head. This all was just a lot. If this was how Cat was inside, and this happened the first time she tried… She herself knew firsthand, and even as an adult, how she felt at the pool with her own first ‘slip’ and Cat’s ‘push away’… And here, both rejection and witnessed by the man Cat had always regarded to this date as her Japanese father.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So what happened?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I buried everything Koona… I became Japanese. Everything I’ve created in my life… is around…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Not being yourself.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No fucking shit, of course not. Nothing was okay about me after that moment. I was repulsive… to Noriko and jesus who knows with Mr. Takeda. We never spoke of it. It was always in the air. He saw me… he saw me kiss a girl. And be rejected for it.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat paused then continued, “No fucking wonder he said nothing. He knew he didn’t have to. To this date I don’t know what he thought really. I never saw Noriko again. I was afraid to even ask less the subject be brought up.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat shook her head, affirming her own realization, “So look at me now. It’s like after that day I stopped remembering this. Or having feelings. Until now.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Because of my place?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Strangely, though, Koona felt this might actually be a good thing and even a pang of hope.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No… well I guess it did bring it back. But…” Cat returned her eyes to rest on Koona’s.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah,” Koona nodded sadly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmmm hmmm. Hmmm.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Dangerous. Tread carefully Koona.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So you never remembered or felt that way again about someone?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus Koona._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You know me… everything was just playing from then on. And being Japanese as I can be. It’s a great culture to repress as you’re served with all the rules of etiquette. Mr. Takeda was so proud of me,” Cat smiled. No matter what she loved that man, so quiet, stern in his way but always with this unspoken gentle lovingness.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Aside that he didn’t console me. The most confusing of it all._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But Cat’s mind and heart was not done processing and quickly interjected with tearful emotion, as if remembering something very important, “I felt good with her. She was a tomboy. But still pretty, just athletic, strong. That’s why I liked her,” she looked away wistfully and smirked, “why it felt good to pin her down... I felt… maybe like her a bit.. strong… I’m just realizing, I was so naive,” she shook her head, “I didn’t distinguish. I thought that’s how boy’s were too. Supposed to be. I’ve been waiting and waiting… for a boy like her. I realize I’ve never found a boy - a man - anything like that, the way it felt.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Koona,” Cat widened her now drying eyes, “and now I’m afraid.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Why sweetheart?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Because…” Cat looked down and uncharacteristically slumped, playing with her hands. After a minute she timidly raised her eyes and turned her head just a little to the side to look at her friend.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was like a second wave of crystallization of what had happened with Mali on _that night._ She thought Mali was _that man_. The tomboy man. He got under her skin, under the radar… But is not a man, Cat scrunched her brows, feeling overwhelmed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona nodded a soft smile, “Because?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat noticed that same hopeful yet wounded tone she had first heard when she reconnected with Koona. Maybe she was imagining it. It was exactly as she herself would sound if she’d ever been herself all these years.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Because…”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I feel like I’ve fucked up my life._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I want to pull you close and never let you go.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’ve never been myself._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Because I need you._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That’s why.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat felt a kind of tunnel-vision dizziness come, like disorientation that had often come and gone over the years and lately more frequently since that night with Mali.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m so obsessed with Japan…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona waited in silence, intending to give her friend space, and after a minute, shook her head and smiled. Cat had fallen asleep mid-sentence, sitting up straight.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So typical. The perfect Japanese woman. Wouldn’t know she’s asleep aside from that she has just stopped responding._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona went to the bedroom area and her eyes quickly fell on her soft body-length pillow. With a glint in her eyes she grabbed it along with a light comforter.&nbsp;
