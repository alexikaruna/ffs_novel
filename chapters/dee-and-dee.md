Cat plunged deeper into the twilight water, continuing to hold her breath for what seemed like a super-human time, and through it a series of semi-conscious thoughts passed that never quite made it through to prime time…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_She’s my best friend!!!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But we’re both Dee’s. Feminine women._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In Thailand it is men and women, Tom’s and Dee’s.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Dee’s and Dee’s? Never.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She had heard of this but the couples were laughed at and called abnormal.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How could it be?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_We’re both not only normal but successful people. High performing!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Far from the night life and the street…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But it was happening right now. Inside her and she’d lost her grip to keep it at bay.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Ah, but I’m not gay._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Somewhere more deeply sub-conscious, Cat had a hope that somehow Koona would make this easy for her. Koona was always there. She was always the one to get things to work right no matter what the situation was…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And without still knowing her true emotions, Cat surfaced and intently looked for Koona where she had been sitting.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because even within all that fear in her was a hope she was not willing to admit, rationalized as friendship. And coming up for air, that hope was now.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As if Koona and the air she’d done without were one and the same thirst.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat’s heart dropped.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona was no longer there.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Or anywhere.
