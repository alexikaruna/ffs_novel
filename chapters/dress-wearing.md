<p class="p1">Arriving back to $er room, although $he was leaving tomorrow and would have to pack in the morning, $he hung up $er new dresses with the hangers provided by the hotel and arranged the other items and accessories $he’d bought on the nice white counter that extended from the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">She’d walked out of the mall with two pairs of shoes - well sandals, three colorful and tasteful dresses, one aqua, one purple and a shorter black one, a pair of really cool sparkly silver earrings and a couple sports bras, she felt complete.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Instead of just letting it all go as $he’d promised $erself, chilling out, turning on a movie and letting the late afternoon turn to night, Mali stood there with one of the t-shirt dresses $he’d bought - a nice gray one - over $er new panties and bra, adding some earrings and the shoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">$he glanced back in the mirror at $erself, turning to see how $he looked from the side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Not perfect but not bad at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>

<p class="p1">It was not unlike what Cat had given $er to wear that night only a bit thicker cotton and form-fitting now.</p>

<p class="p1">$he felt warm inside as the next thought passed…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>I will go out in this. Now.</i></p>

<p class="p1">It was not a question but a statement. $he glanced over at the clothes rack and the other colored dresses now there. This was $er room, $er things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Something so right about this</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">A wave of wellbeing washed over $er. Warmth $he’d not felt in some time. Not since being embraced by Cat. And before that… who knows.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>I could go out in this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>

<p class="p1">Mali stood there for a second as the imperative set in.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>I’m going to go out in this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>

<p class="p1"><i>***</i></p>


<p class="p1">So $he did.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>It was the biggest non-event. Except that…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>

<p class="p1"><i>It was a non-event!</i></p>

<p class="p1">Arriving back at the hotel a couple hours later $he felt almost like a different person. A different person than usually arrived back home after being out. The old person was always exhausted and trying to shake off and deal with the negativity $he felt $he felt from others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>This time I feel clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>

<p class="p1">$he had walked back to the street and up to stroll the park and then get some dinner. It was mid-evening and the Sunday crowd was still out en-masse, on the street and in the park. With the heat of the day gone, everyone was enjoying the sweet Bangkok evening.</p>

<p class="p1">And Mali was just among them today. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">$he felt $erself standing and walking taller. More confident, and to what it felt, more gracefully. $he was not sure if it came from the clothes or from knowing that in a dress $he had to be at $er best. In a dress there was nothing to hide bad posture nor sloppy movement. It was still evident in $er own head although to an onlooker even Mali’s ‘sloppy movements’ naturally held a grace that a good number of genetic women would practice to obtain.</p>

<p class="p1">$he actually found $erself slowing down, smiling as $he walked the circular path that went around the lake. Couples, the children playing, exercisers…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">After tiring of the park $he strolled up through the still busy Emporium Mall, a brightly lighted place where there was nowhere to hide. The kind of place generally $he didn’t care for sandwiched in-between unwanted attention and so many pretentious self-entitled asian women.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">All the while, what was curious to Mali about this ‘first dress excursion’ was that…</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Everything went smoothly.</i></p>

<p class="p1">People smiled or at least ignored $er. No one pointed or laughed or seemed to fixate eyes, as $he had been used to in her andro clothes. The food court staff too seemed more friendly and courteous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>What is this?</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Fact was Thailand of all places is a rather gender polarized culture. Mali noticed even the lesbian couples tended to be in pairs of butch and femme.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>So maybe its that… I’ve joined humanity??? At least here?</i></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Or maybe that I’m more confident in a dress? Or just tonight?</i></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Or maybe that I’m more congruent and not fighting myself?</i></p>

<p class="p1">Whatever it was, it was unexpected and a welcome surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Perhaps the biggest one in years. Why did I wait so long?</i></p>

<p class="p1">$he felt it in this moment, this x-factor of feeling feminine, not just inside but confidently in the world. It was something that on rare occasions came to $er, such a feeling. But before Face, especially, the possibility of living in this feeling felt like an impossibility.</p>

<p class="p1">Having pulled $her dress off carefully over $er head and hung it up with its companions, $he sprawled on the bed with $er legs up on the wall, exhausted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Mali racked $er emotional brain and couldn’t find a spark of the old nostalgia that for recent years had been the only impetus to try to be a man. Or to want a woman who wanted such. Something had shifted.</p>

<p class="p1">In less than rational or very conscious manner, as a pre-bedtime snooze came over $er the words came to $er,</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Now I think I’m ready to meet Anastasia.</i></p>
