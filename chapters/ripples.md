> Marching to the promised land  
> Where the honey flows and takes you by the hand,  
> Pulls you down on your knees,  
> While you're down a pool appears.  
> The face in the water looks up,  
> And she shakes her head as if to say  
> That it's the last time you'll look like today…
> 
> The face that launched a thousand ships  
> Is sinking fast, that happens you know,  
> The water gets below.  
> Seems not very long ago  
> Lovelier she was than any that I know.

> Sail away, away  
> Ripples never come back.  
> Gone to the other side.  
> Sail away, away.
