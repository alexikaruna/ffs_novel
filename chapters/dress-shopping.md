<p class="p1"><i>Shit already or get off the pot!</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The long morning of the constant movement of travel and getting situated <i>this time</i> in Bangkok now had decelerated from light speed to 0 in a moment once the last of $er belongings had been placed somewhere reasonable on the extensive counters that basically surrounded the room without other storage space. It was only mid-afternoon but felt like yesterday that $he’d walked with $er bag in tow down the rural streets of Chiang Rai.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Entering the lobby, $he realized $he’d become a regular at the Nantra Sukhumvit Hotel, greeted with a known warmness and familiarity which felt good. The wild thing about living as an expat, as $he’d also encountered when living in Mexico were these moments when you realize the concept of ‘home’ has shifted and become a relative term. Just as returning to Chiang Rai actually was home now, not the USA. And the Nantra a home now too.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">$he laid on $er faithful yoga mat, stretched and let go, turning $er head side to side and then and staring up at the white painted ceiling of $er little room. With the Face, the coming of Anastasia and all the travel, well, not to mention the reacquaintance with K, $he felt disoriented now, but in a way that offered new freedom. Similar feeling to when $he’d left a job or a relationship, a freedom and ease. Like there was a surplus of time, space and directionality open to $er, for the taking.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Something magical also was going on with embracing $er apparent distaste for $erself, or as Face had called it, ‘hate’. It was like $he’d spent $er life bracing against this aggressively intrusive outer world. And in doing so prevented $erself from being $erself. But now that $he turned the hate $he’d imagined the world had for $er inward, strangely $he felt more free.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>And Cat…</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The hold Cat had on $er - and really the idea of keeping $erself as a man - had really seemed to relax. Almost overnight. Somewhere in between their last conversation and the Face’s lesson…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>It’s as if I don’t even find the feeling that drove me to play that game. Or to even want to.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">The impulse whatever it was that drove $er <i>there</i> was apparently gone. Like a place you found once in a city but can not for the life of you find your way back to it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>I don’t need to be a man anymore.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>For anything. For anyone.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>There’s no one - nothing - there for me anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>My dream… love… relationship… could never happen being a man.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Being a lie.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Too, $he strangely felt more okay… to go further. A certain thought had started coming up the last few days. Initially let go and dismissed but now to the point which it had to be acted upon.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>A new level of exploration.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Unthinkable even a week before.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">$he smirked playfully, knowing in $er gut that this had to happen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Going to happen.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And like everything that comes about in it’s own time, today was perfect for it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>And I know exactly where to go.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was the perfect combination of motivation, excitement coupled with anxiety that made things in life exciting.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>I have no idea how this will go. I just have to try.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>I might just feel awkward… and that’s okay. It’s okay… at any point I end this experiment.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>I might be laughed at even more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">$he had realized over the years that the best is to take the things $he felt inclined to do in respect to ‘dressing’ and try them. Without committal or expectation. To see how $he felt and go from there. $er entire progression toward the feminine had been in this way. Up to and including the use of hormones which $he was trying out now. Empirically determining who $he was.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>And Anastasia is coming tomorrow.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">For some reason it seemed important to do this now, before she got here.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Anyhow, if things feel bad, go bad, all I have to do is remember too…</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>‘I hate myself’</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It’d worked so far and miraculously, it seemed, had paved the way to this moment, the next adventure and exploration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A mantra that gave power.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And so Mali pulled $erself up from the yoga mat, arranged $erself and set out to make it happen. Deep inside in addition to the excitement was a sense of warm comfort even just thinking about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">In Thailand, shopping malls are the extended living space of the population. Where the streets and outdoors are just a tolerated nuisance during the day, the malls are filled with all types. Filled is the key. Not overly crowded but definitely filled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mali shook $er head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Thailand malls are… the best in the world. Spending the day is not painful, even relaxing.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Such as was Terminal 21 today, the large eight floored shopping mega-complex across the street from the high-rise where Cat’s clinic was located. It felt like the center of the universe - both the MRT subway and the BTS skyway line converged onto the raised pedestrian overpass which fed into the mall as well as the street, Sukhumvit which ran the ends of the city.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mali made $er way, picking out the shaded places to deviate $er walking path to avoid the early afternoon sun, coming upon and passing people alone and in groups that were on their way too.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">$he chose the mall because its floor of boutique stores - actually more like stalls. She had walked by them often while frequenting the mall after attending $er Thai classes across the street. Mali realized in this moment of the domino effect - from Thai class, to walking in randomly to Cat’s clinic in the same building, to this moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>It’s like everything is for a reason… again.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">It seemed so often since starting to ‘go to hell’ that nothing seemed to make sense or flow.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Anyhow, the stores had the kind of cloths she knew would like to wear. Colors, fashionable, form fitting in great part, but that they were surprisingly reasonably price compared to the name brand stores on the other floors.</p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Definitely Thai style, this floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">All black, floors and walls, and a maze-like complex of the halls shooting off from the center where $he stood in the midst of a cafe that specialized only in green tea concoctions and a Hagen Dazs counter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Definitely my place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Offsetting the blackness were the windows and contents of the little stores, radiating with color. So much more pleasing than the operating room white light bathed upscale stores on the other levels. Unconsciously to $er, this offered a kind of feeling of safety and protection than such other places, the too-bright lights exposing everything and so often filled with catty self-entitled women.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mali knew she was making up for lost time and that not everything she would buy would be perfect but $he wanted some sort of completion that day. $he needed some shoes, nice sandals perhaps, something she could walk a lot in, and black to go with whatever else she would buy. Then dresses. And if she found some nice earrings, jewelry that would be very helpful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Oh… and bras. Shit… bras.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>That’s gonna be the hard one.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">She had no idea how to shop for bras. Especially bras that were basically unnecessary physically but for cultural and emotional necessity.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">So with a plan, and the necessary militant energy to make things happen, $he began the mission…</p>

* * *

<p class="p1">“This for girlFRIEND?” the store clerk intoned innocently, smiling the always ebullient ‘hello smile’, the one that melts the heart of first time foreigner, who loses their mind as they don’t realize there are twelve other smiles the Thai people wear and they all mean different things, even this one.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was the game Mali was so used to playing in $er mind - ‘how in the world are others seeing me?’. The response of the other person or people played into and determined $er relation to them and in a way who $he was.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>And how I feel about myself.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Oh yeah… I hate myself.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Of course, when $he was assumed as a man or gay, then $he’d play <i>lets make a list of what’s wrong with me this time.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">So what was so wrong with $er today, at this juncture, that $he was assumed to be a man shopping for a girlfriend?</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Fuck me. I hate myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">That was the unfortunate thing, for an in-between person wanting to appear feminine. As a woman could go out without makeup, and even with combat boots and Mali’s exact outfit and still be read as female.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>But not me. Not in a million years.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>I look like a fucking gay guy at best.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>What the hell is it? The bone structure of my face, lack of breasts, and the somewhat tense, rigid, a bit masculine way I think I still move?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It was something that $he always fought with. As if $er body was still afraid and thus tense while another part of $er wanted to be free. Always at odds.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll try it on, kaaa?”, Mali replied. $he felt less awkward in being adamant today. Actually, $he wanted this so much $he really didn’t give a shit right now about anyone’s attitude or perception of $er. Or to walk out of a store with something $he wanted because of how $he was treated.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Fuck you if you think you’re going to get in my way today.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>I’m going to make this happen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ah, kaaaa,”, the saleswoman smiled knowingly. No big deal. It was Bangkok. Ladyboy everywhere. Even farang ladyboy here.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She gestured to the dressing room. As Mali entered $he sighed and shook off the situation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Leaving with two dresses, the next stop was easier. It was a kiosk that had these amazing long t-shirt material dresses. And also some more edgy stuff, leather and jewelry. This place was not a problem at all, the younger saleswoman getting who Mali was without missing a beat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mali left there with a second bag full of another dress and some assorted inexpensive faux-silver jewelry.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The shoe department at one of the larger department stores was another story. Many saleswomen all hovering around. The bright white and lights fatiguing Mali who’d been through quite a day. And what felt like attitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mali could feel and knew $er resilience was wearing thin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">But this was still going to happen. The inertia would not permit failure here.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The problem had been that although $er feet were within female range, perhaps to the upper end, $he was in Thailand, the land of the petite and not only that, $he had no idea how shoe sizes worked for anyone here.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Measure feet ka?” Mali inquired.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The saleswoman shook her head as if she didn’t understand.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Maybe no have your size.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Fuck you.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mali felt the remark as a bit snarky and that the woman wanted this strange androgynous farang gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Not going to happen today.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">After some trials, $he finally left with a pair of not ugly but not gorgeous practical type sandals in hand, the ones that had a strap over the front of the foot and one around the back of foot and ankle, way better looking than Birkenstocks and less outdoorsy than Tevas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>They’d do for now. And heck, they’re comfortable!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>I’m done.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>

* * *

<p class="p1">After a few hours she was exhausted. Not from just shopping but as a woman. It had been a tremendous amount of psychic energy withdrawal from the bank that at the start of the outing was full up from the ecstasy of travel, all the growth in the past week not to mention anticipation of meeting Anastasia.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">And every interaction with others, it seemed, to have a price, in the currency of $er confidence. As always. Realizing and feeling mirrored back that not everyone that was helping her saw her the way $he saw $erself hurt. $he was sensitive but then again, this mission was so important $he had put those feelings on the back burner for once.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Mali sat in a daze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">$he’d treated herself to a green tea affogatto, a hot green tea with a scoop of green tea ice cream in it - this cafe’s answer to the coffee drinking world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">$he watched the passing shoppers. Actually the feet of the passing shoppers, now with a sensitized awareness to shoes. $he was thinking about $er shoe - sandal - choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>I won’t deceive myself. I have not broken the shoe code yet.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">She watched the girls and women passing by and made notes of who had ‘nailed it’ and who just was ‘so so’. And why that was so. Color coordination was definitely in. Shoes and something else on the outfit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Sandals with painted toenails…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Definitely hot.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Sandals or open toed shoes with sparkle…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Extra points if they sparkled with color</i>…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">High heels…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Uh lets not go there. I’m tall enough and what’s the point…</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Closed toed shoes… with or without a small heel…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Fucking witches shoes. Why do women wear that ugly shit?</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">$he stared out at shoppers for probably half an hour more focusing on closed toed shoes… and could not find one example contrary of hot closed toed shoes. Although focusing on this one element of dress, $he had no question without anyone telling $er, what $he liked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Turning to the thought of dresses. It had to be dresses for now. If anything she had learned, is that to compensate for indicators that say ‘male’ when someone looks at you, one had to stack everything possible in the other direction. So transgender women had to in essence do more than genetic women to have any semblance of passing - of being read as female, meaning enough elements were female that they tipped the brain and senses of the perceiver. She knew this from actual experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Before wigs it was all about clothes and makeup. That was an awful period $he chose not to dwell on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Ultra gay looking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p class="p2"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p1">Especially when $he’d shaved $er head in hopes of appearing like Sinead O’Connor. Which didn’t work at all.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then the bandanas as a head cover attempt. Which more than once combined with his overly slender stature led people to ask if he was sick. Horrible.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then wigs, a step in the right direction but…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Finally and especially the hair transplants there was a feeling of being more ‘okay’ as is. A relatively female hair line. No more need for wigs and horrible bandanas, less makeup.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The funny thing too, with each improvement in femininity - the hair transplants, the rhinoplasty - after each Mali would ask ‘maybe I did not need to do all this’ but forgetting all the steps $he’d already made. Which only became apparent when, ignorant of such, $he would return to try male mode and each time feel progressively not right.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Hua Hin. I don’t want to ever do that again, okay Mali?</i> <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
