“I think we made a mistake,” the words escaped Cat’s lips as if they had a life of their own.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A mistake._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I feel responsible. I don’t know what came over me. I shouldn’t have…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

These were her first words and she’d had no idea she’d say this. They were rude and insensitive.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not of your class, Cat._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Because I didn’t plan them._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe this is why Thai women get the reputation for being self-entitled bitches.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Hmmm…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And now that’s me.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Only in close relationship does one have the chance to see the jagged edges in oneself. Cat was not used to seeing such in herself as she was basically aloof in dating, so it was a blow to her otherwise polished and ultra-polite Japanese educated Thai self-image. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Without volition, Cat flashed again to Mali’s waist and lower back… Followed in the next in rapid succession… of that last moment with Koona… when the seemingly inevitable kiss that Koona had been moving towards…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat… what are you thinking???_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She would have liked for what happened with Koona to have been different and this now to be different but it couldn’t be.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Because how could it be?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not gay.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And I want a man._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With those two checkboxes marked, she knew she was writing off the two people she’d been closest to in perhaps her whole life, the best friends ever.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Done and done.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m a superficial and self-centered bitch and I know it now.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was about appearance. But so much more. Mali as female simply felt out in the cold and dangerous although she could not completely put her finger on as to why she felt that way.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_There are reasons. Very good ones though._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I just wanted to see and talk to you in person.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Because I still had hope for something else._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Despite her usual composure, a telltale tear fell from her right meticulously painted eye belying the mechanical precision of the rest of her demeanor. Which ignited just a little spark of hope in Mali’s heart.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_At least she feels something._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because in the end, even in the embers of who and what ‘he’ was in the past, this fire would never extinguish, $he knew. This longing. The original dream. If someone asked what $he had always wanted in life…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It was this, right in front of $er._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That night_… it seemed to resolve everything. Who $he was. Who SHE was. At least with Cat and in her…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What is that even called, an embrace???_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali felt the memory of that moment when Cat took $er to the limit of the world. HER and Cat. A crystallization. In presence of Cat’s feminine, and dominant loving essence. There were no promises. And something in $er still didn’t want to accept this.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_You just don’t have nights like that without it meaning something.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Over $er gender exploration years, in time $he became closer to who $he was while seemingly making more improbable ever fulfilling the longings of $er heart.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_You don’t increase your already sucky relationship odds by looking more gay and feminine than you already are…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The usual maybe once or twice a year of meeting a potential girlfriend had fallen to zero. Whether it was $er own complex that did it or $er appearance. But somehow on _that_ night, Cat singlehandedly leapfrogged that bridge. For a moment in time $he saw the future $he longed for as a possibility. Having both.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But then nothing…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The weeks of ensuing silence between them, the experience instead was on its way to being another case in point.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Of going to hell.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Killing half of $erself for the dream, or the dream for $erself. Neither of which had the will to die a natural death on their own.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat looked intently at Mali and raised her brows at Mali’s silence. $he had just then begun to have a ‘what the fuck’ moment inside which went something like…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I just flew in to Bangkok for this?!&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Did I somehow become Cat’s bitch?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_In the most wrong way?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Its just not what I want. You’re amazing, its just that I really want to be with a man, and that’s not who you are.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s ears selectively shut off for a moment out of self-protection and heard just sound. Cat continued what might have been for a minute or two.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“…So it seems…” The last phrase turned up just enough to be hinting at question as she added, “… who you want to be… right?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali snapped out of $er confused upset. It was true. _That night_ was an experiment and they had entered it with the agreement to let it be. No promises, no knots.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Who I _want_ to be?” Mali raised $er eyebrows. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When people talked like that it was the biggest fuck you of all.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Who in their right mind would do what I’m doing if it was truly a choice? What person in their right mind would cross the gender line to live without something very powerful driving it? I know I wouldn’t._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The world seemed to think this was a choice. A Thai acquaintance had also made it clear that in her culture, one choses their appearance based on who they wished to attract and be with, not upon internal authenticity, in the case of any conflict with the culture, “A ladyboy with a woman? Unheard of. How would the woman respect herself?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali too treated it that way. As a possible aberration. Even up to now, except for the fact that no matter what $he did neither dream nor impulse would change or go away. It had been years.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And then Cat entered the picture._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Conflicts with no resolution always made Mali’s body tense and angry, as if both sides were tensing opposing muscles, embodying the stuckness. It was really the main thing that would anger $er in life - feeling this way. It’s what made $er heart turn colder.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And truthfully this feeling is what $he knew about being a man. Because being a man had always had this quality of frustration for $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And not much else._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And as such, in contrast to the joy $he found in $erself more and more, being a man became increasingly repulsive to $er. Like stagnant water, a smelly swamp. Truthfully, that’s how ‘man’ felt. How $he felt about men. And foreign. Like it was a game $he had to put a lot of focus on to pull off.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So the connection we felt was not real?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No, it was real. And nice. But it was alone, behind doors. I’m talking about all of life, everything. I just can’t handle it,” her hand fanned out and across the table as if to emphasize Mali’s appearance,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Being with a katoey. Even a woman… imagine, not a Tom but a Dee! I don’t know, I just can’t do it, I’m sorry. Now I realize when I started falling for you, I saw you as a rockstar, sweet and gentle and so many things. I still see those! But on that night…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat slowed and unusually fumbled for words, “It’s just, it would be unfair to expect you to be that. To be what you’re not. Things just went too far too fast that night.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded. And that was true. All of it. $he’d had the thoughts too, those of changing $erself to meet Cat’s likely expectations in a partner.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck me even for still doubting myself.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was beyond $er how many trans-women $he knew could make a decision and transition within a year. And $he’d been sitting on the pot over twelve yet.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But what does it matter? I mean, were not talking about us not getting along, agreeing on things and no doubt the bedroom. How often do you meet someone that feels simply transparent? Easy? Fun?!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It just does. You don’t understand my position here, I mean my family aside, who is very open, I have other associations and I don’t know, it wouldn’t feel right. Its just not what I can face now in my life. Its too much for me.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But how do you feel now? With me?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Wonderful,” her eyes upturned in a gentle smile and contact, just like in the earlier days of their friendship, sending that old familiar warmth into Mali’s heart.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Me as a woman?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well of course. But I just can’t do it, in life. It doesn’t feel right.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But we’re here, out in public now?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But Mali, that’s just it, you and me. I mean in the end what does it matter, some clothes and makeup? You could just dress as you were before, heck even a little makeup. You looked like a rockstar. Rockstar can be that way in the bedroom. They’re different. But katoey, now, well…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And what’s inside? Everyone who stares and laughs at me? About my body and face not matching? Even as a ‘rockstar’!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That’s just on the outside. I know who you are. That’s what matters.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Then why make the outside matter anyway?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Because it does to me still.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Because if I could accept being with a woman I’d be with Koona.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The unexpected words in her mind hit Cat like a freight train. Her eyes furrowed at a realization never considered in light of Mali, who for all intensive purposes had filled the void in her life left by the absence of her now ex-best friend.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That’s insane, Cat. Because from my side, everything else here seems perfect and how many times does life offer us that? You’d give it all up for this?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Aren’t you?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali played with the candle burning in the middle of the table. $he was not surprised. It was how things, love - with someone $he really wanted - always ended up. $er heart was breaking, as it was accustomed. $he had learned time and again to detach from the longing for the outcome. For the return call, the second date, the goodnight kiss. Always ready and not surprised to receive the friend zone instead — or just nothing at all.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A ghost.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And now detached once more, $he did not care to have tact and not to spill some of the worst words a true American can speak:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So you’re giving me a choice? To be myself or to be with you?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat let her head angle downward to her lap as if in passive affirmative, where she kept it. Then with her head still down, she dealt the final blow.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Quietly and in almost a whisper as if she knew how hard it would hit with all Japanese sternness, “You have to be who you are. And too, you know my sister, hormones change many things and you’ve barely touched them. How can I really know? How can you really know what you truly want right now? Even romantically. You’re just starting the change. If you are even.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To Cat it helped simply the way Mali presented tonight. There’s no way she could handle… a rockstar, yes… but a flaming transitional katoey?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali would have kicked $erself to have known this. But in the end, it was the same kick $he’d been dealing $erself on a daily, often minute by minute basis for years.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Being something… else… for someone else… for fucking hope’s sake._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he knew it was over, the familiar black hole was there in the pit of $er stomach. $he knew that $he could not argue Cat’s last point in any convincing way. Cat was right. Hormones were a notorious unknown. She was in fact just starting.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not even sure if I’m really a woman. Fuck me for not knowing. Not even proven myself… to ME!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

No worse nightmare existed. $he had failed to know or accept $erself enough to have a solid identity. And now that $he’d met the perfect women and everything was…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

FUBAR.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Check._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Each side with barbs that dig in. Pain and bleeding in either direction. Hurts going in and just as bad coming out. Or to just leave it, not move and not to breathe. Which would lead to absolutely nothing and safety but not actually living.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Oh yeah, that’s exactly the life I have right now._
