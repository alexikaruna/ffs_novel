Mali sat in the crowded Top’s Market cafeteria, which was on the basement level of the mall. With a bowl of duck noodle soup in front of $er, $he ate slowly, while looking around. It was a surreal contrast to where $he had been even an hour ago. But it was Thailand. Where almost absolute contrasts were just part of a normal day.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The place was lit with fluorescent lights giving it a feel that made you not want to linger too long beyond the tasty food. On the perimeter were the myriad food booths where one could choose from virtually any type of Thai regional food, not to mention other options like Indian and Halal.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The crowd there was an overall sample of the population of Chiang Mai. Many Thais, families, young couples, couples with children. Some Thai-Muslim’s, and occasionally what looked like more ‘serious’ Muslim people. The difference to Mali being the combination of colorful dress and lighter smiling faces compared to just the standard black and more solemn attitudes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And what’s the deal with a woman in a black Birka and her guy wearing shorts and a t-shirt???_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then there were assorted expat riff-raff — men or women who looked like they might be more comfortable sitting on a Harley or at a biker bar. But if you talked to them, like Mali rarely did, they all had a story. And expats tended to be quite nice.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Every expat foreigner in Thailand had a story. The Thai culture tended to designate people either as Thai or ‘farang’, a word originally meaning ‘barbarian white person’. It was something perplexing, something Mali often considered at length. Set against the ever present Thai smiles and sensitivity, this us vs them distinction made what often seemed like an impermeable wall. One that newcomers to Thailand, $erself included, would easily miss.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The collective sum of expats had a shared culture and experience. Anyone who had to face the monthly visa runs vs Thai language school visa decision, hailing cabs, ordering food, local vs foreigner prices, not to mention the question of love. The concept of which was discussed endlessly in online blogs and forums. Well, about love between men and women. Forums which now were basically academic to Mali.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To Mali up until Cat, $he had started to think that as a foreigner $he’d always be on the outside culturally. As if there was some unwritten thing floating in the air that categorically created and enforced in _every_ Thai person to be kind and friendly, yet unknowable. Much less, accessible for a true relationship beyond talking about superficial things like the weather, the traffic, or what’s good to eat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Given that, Mali found a fascination in the third group presenting in the food court, the generally older white man with the young Thai wife. And sometimes younger farang men with their Thai partner. Sometimes with baby in tow. From what $he understood it was often a mix of economic needs, cultural crosstalk and maybe a good measure mental erase.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Perhaps even split-morality._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Too, once in a while $he thought $he could see a couple who was actually ‘real’ -- had actual intimacy -- in this group. But more often than not the Thai woman seemed to lead the guy around, seeming more like a tour-guide doing her job.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali chuckled to $erself, $he’d love to acquire that skill, the Thai mental erase.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_For my own purposes._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If $he was honest, there was a fourth group represented here. The farang katoey.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Just one of them.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Albeit today $he felt stronger and more secure, Cat’s confidence and embrace having rubbed off. Of course in this mall, at every juncture you’d run into a Thai katoey -- transgender woman. It was commonplace. It was one reason $he especially liked this mall in particular. And Chiang Mai in general. It was more of an educated katoey population. Many were students.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Real._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But nonetheless, usually $he was the only farang $he’d in this category. And nothing reminded $er more of this than sitting in a Thai shopping center.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fucking fishbowl.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although Kad Suan Kaew was one of the most chill from unwanted attention.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But mulling over the familiar series of perceptions, Mali felt between the two worlds today. Because what had just happened this morning had seemingly taken the things $he thought $he knew and cast them into an unknown reality. Stereotypes and prejudice are exacerbated by isolation. Cat and her family this morning had taken black and white and cast them all into a rainbow.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus, literally!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt the constriction of sadness and tears inside, now sitting alone, all of the sudden. In the midst of what seemed like now again unknowable chaos, with Cat in the distance being the form that unified things back to colorful coherence and light, combined with the fuel of the ever-held longing and conviction in $er own heart.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Returning to the bus station, Mali was dazed. The kaleidoscope of $er inner fragmentation had shifted. But just as a kaleidoscope, it was a new arrangement of light and colors but the pattern that put it in motion was one and the same as before.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was simply mystical.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Almost felt karmic that way.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Too perfect.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What should have made $er ebullient was now attacking Mali at every place of conflict $he had.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I think I love her.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If there was one thing Mali knew, it was $er core dream. And $he knew how to recognize it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But maybe I can’t make her happy?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Won’t make her happy…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sexually. Like $er past girlfriends. In many cases they were satisfied with $er, even very. Well, until they insisted on the gender role. Then was $he who felt off. Incomplete. It was $he who always broke things off in the end, like a bull in a china shop, by $er nature, or what rather seemed to be $er inherent brokenness.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not enough for her. Even if I tried. Which would still fail. It always comes back to this._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Would I be happy really?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Why would it be any different here?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The only possible way out was the path $he had not tried, was with a woman so amazing. Such a love that would override whatever was broken in $er. A woman who being with $er, so amazing that $he would have no need or space for this quest of feminine in $erself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I could let this all go and just revel in her._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But even as Mali imagined this possible outcome, $he felt an anxiety build in $er thinking of being with Cat ‘as a man’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Because that is what I’d be, right?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But Cat is on another level, right?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe it would be different. Like today._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was true, Cat was the complete package. In the time $he’d known $er, there was nothing that made $er feel there could be anyone else more amazing than $er. Beautiful, smart, a companion capable of never-ending conversation and intimacy, fun, and a woman who owned her life, independent and self-sufficient. $he still had a bit of trouble believing that Cat saw what whole rest of the world missed seeing in $er. Because Mali knew inside $er depth and how amazing $he was, despite $er conflicted exterior. But for Cat to see this and want to be even just $er friend, was against all odds.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And much less, more than that._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Could be._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just maybe._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Maybe $he and Cat could be a match sexually. $he was conscious that $he was thinking sexually, not romantically. Because the fact was, $he had no question they were a romantic match.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There something off with $er as a man. A hint that $he was gay? Because being penetrated - as a man - wanting something phallic inside, a penis, made $er gay? No, that wasn’t it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That does not make someone gay. Duh!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Too… $he didn’t have any attraction to any man attached to such a penis. And that’s where phallic transgender women came in.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But then…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I don’t want to be a man with them.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he did not feel like a man there either.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And… that’s how $he’d gotten here. Right here. In this place, in these clothes, walking in these shoes._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Paradoxically it was this ultra-soft, gentle woman who was $er last hope. Cat. None of $er girlfriends to date had been gentle enough. Even after asking for what $he needed. $he hated the feeling of being groped. Of the expectation of ‘fucking’ the woman, it felt like being an object, a machine, to 'perform'. $he wanted to melt and bond. That’s where $er sexuality - the one that felt good in - came from. The one that made $er cry when $he came. If $he could feel this, $he could penetrate, but only in the most gentle and soft way. The second the connection weakened or broke, it was over.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So maybe Cat?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But would $he no longer need to be penetrated? Because to express this deep part of $er sexuality, $he couldn’t be a man.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It isn’t possible._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not a man.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not there…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And this had been the deal-breaker in the past. And even so, Cat did not feel particularly dominant to $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he tried to imagine this but failed. $he would not have Cat taking $er that way, as a man. Even if Cat was totally into it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Repulsive._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But can I ever really present as a woman?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To the point where a woman who wants a woman is attracted to me?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That Cat would see me as a woman, really._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because that was where it always ended. $he turned on the camera of $er phone and looked at $er face. The male-ish face looking back at $er made $er bristle.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No chance._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Would I stop waxing?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Could I?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali historically always returned to waxing even after trying to stop for some months. Of course making things worse because the first time back would always be summarily more painful than if she’d just maintained it._&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Will I stop taking the pills to keep my hair from balding?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Stop estrogen and see my skin get less soft? And my body-fat distribute as a man's does?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Will Cat quit work like my ex and expect ‘him’ to provide?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he winced. It was a disgusting thought, albeit totally illogical, given what $he now knew about Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So regardless of the goodness of the day, Mali’s heart sunk.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_There was no way out.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No happy ending however I slice it._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Be a man. Or be myself. Be with Cat or be me.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I guess…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the accompanying depression, Mali’s conscious processing petered out and sleepy trance settled in as $he relaxed in the seat, snuggled in $er down jacket as protection from the infamous frigid A/C of this particular bus line, staring out the window at the passing scenery.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was nothing else $he could do or think. Everything was shit, even at the end of one of the best days of her life.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The late afternoon sunset did its part in the lull, the comfort of that time of day was always so big to $er. The sunrise was always freshness, but this time of day was romantic time. Of being a bit tired and sleepy even, and a time when it was easy to feel things.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And who I long for._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And how it would feel to be… in her arms... to surrender..._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had met with this feeling again and again in the past but missed the lesson in it, just like today. The depression required $er to first feel who - and what - $he really was. The point of hopelessness in the ‘real world’ was only the conduit.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The place of making a choice.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Going to hell._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now with the promise of the unlikely but real Cat, lifting $er out of that chasm.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_My lifeline._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali suddenly jolted.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I have to decide who I am.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Now._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So that the lifeline would not be cut by mistake.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not again.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he knew how rare meeting Cat was.&nbsp;The chance of such a connection happening again was...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Minimal on my trajectory._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was beyond all women. If there was ‘perfect’, it was her.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was as if $er real life experience with Cat had now wedged itself into the fantastic dream originated by $er three year old self - that also now seemed to be unfolding.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And making its demands.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Without thinking, $he brought $er hand to $er heart, feeling gently into the flesh as he would comfort a child,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I love you. Whoever you are. I’m sorry for ignoring you and worse. I’m sorry for causing you so much pain. I need to know what you really want. I'll let go of Cat.. I'll let go of anything. Just tell me.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he cried and $er body shook, silent tears streamed feely down $er face, pooling at $er neck, wetting the down fabric as $he stared out the now darkening dusk sky.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was glad for the darkness around and in the bus.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Katoey farang nobody.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With the fairytale-like appearance and magic of the Thai countryside passing by, $he had no answers and was lost.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Alone, in a strange foreign land.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And in an equally remote place with $erself inside.
