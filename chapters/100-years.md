Mali sat alongside the gentle brook. Glimmering fish, white, yellow and brilliant orange sparking a contrast against the black rocks in the twilight. Playing and flowing through the evening, alive and oblivious of the pain and despair looming nearby.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Swimming and swishing through their evening. Beautiful and alive, thriving, slithering. To Mali what looked like playing. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just being themselves, in all they are._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Vibrant, alone and en masse. $he couldn’t help but feel a natural connection to them.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Isn’t this all that any of us really want? To let life run through us, to be embodied and express what we are fully? To be, to flow? Be around others doing the same thing and in communion? Without having to worry?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was a moment that reminded $er of the mystery, similar to looking out on the stars on a clear night. Reminding $er $he knew nothing about how this was all put together, the fabric of life… and everything that exists.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The only reliable barometer $he seemed to have was expression, feeling and being after joy and the enigmatic longing to bond - yet always on its skirt tails. Which came out when $he hoop-danced, when $he practiced $er standing. The same river of impetus that had brought $er exactly here - who $he was, to Thailand, the clothes, makeup, surgeries…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And how it would feel to truly embrace and be embraced in someone.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If I ever get to again._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was exactly what these fish spoke to $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Vanity.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That was the deal-stopping thought time and again. That made $er run back to ‘being a man’ over the years. Not just changing clothes and getting back to ‘man’ ways, but actually purging the female from $er life, throwing clothes and everything else away as if _this time_ it would be different.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Letting go of myself._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just living. Being._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Isn’t all the rest of this fem stuff simply self-indulgent?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Selfish?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Alienating myself from others?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And from my deepest longing for love?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Seriously, as a dude I’d do well in Thailand, being younger and more attractive alternative to the geezers. With Cat!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then $he remembered, $he wouldn’t have ever come to Thailand if it weren’t for the katoey, the fem in $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’d have stayed forever in Mexico probably._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But at the end of life, even in later years when the body becomes less ‘perfect’, would it matter?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And the cost?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This life is ONCE._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What am I doing??!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Am I killing me?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Causing suffering, to my own flesh?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

How was it, this unknowable intelligence and gift, within $erself be the same that was seemingly guiding $er to turn a knife against $er own organism?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The fish as if their oscillation in the water ran through Mali’s gut reminding $er of the sperm in $er that were, probably, even at this moment, dying off from the hormones $he was taking.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And eventually would no longer exist either.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As much as $he hated being a man, that was reality.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What was $he doing to parts of $er physical self? Was there a being who was supposed to come from $er?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The livelihood of what $er body was as-is would be able to continue to live and possibly thrive if $he got off this train and damn soon.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The sperm and cells in $er were just like those fish.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Unknowable.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The nature of life itself. A nature $he didn’t and would never completely understand. The mystery from which sperm emerge from nothing it seems, not to mention how they can combine with an egg and create life.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like stars that are being born.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How the fuck can I take that into my own hands?!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Only as much as $he could imagine - and $he couldn’t - jumping into the brook and with a knife taking life away from even one of these fish, could $he imagine doing that to $er own body.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Yet $he was now, had been and was contemplating doing more. The woman in the magazine…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The face that launched a thousand ships…_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In this moment sitting here with these fish $he knew time was up.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Up to this point it had all been play - dressing, makeup, slenderizing… with who knows what kind of impact.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And the fish below had just presented $er the balance sheet.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A drive toward death?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Destruction?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Is this the death instinct in me?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Going to hell?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The game was over. These fish. $er body, it was of course $er body still no matter how $he looked at it. A body born and grown, as if magically, as if any of us really know the ultimate mystery. Inside a womb for nine months. The same womb $er brother inhabited a couple years after. From a woman and man who despite their flaws gave this being love and cared for $er and wanted $er to exist and to continue existing and to be happy…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Who was $he to take the knife against all this? All these gifts? Taking the knife to what was to date virtually perfect health._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Against all the love in the universe?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And the facial feminization surgery - the FFS. Just as with the fish and the sperm, every cell in $er body was alive. Each one would feel at the level of their nature every incision and scratch, anesthesia or not. There was no doubt in $er mind.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But maybe $he too was like those fish - striving for life and to thrive, to be true. Misguided or not, her days, even the sacrifice of income and stability were all about this. Counterintuitive to most of the world, even stupid. Seeking $erself, then in step turning the knife against $er own body by its own instructions.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Barbaric ordination it seemed. Even tainted with evil.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A system consciously transforming itself.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was the dream. Not an exaggeration, the original dream. The fem in $er already existed then and $he knew how it felt. But back thin it was before it was a contradiction to love. A condition against it. A ‘no’ rather than a ‘yes’ from Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The grace and beauty of the living being whose arms $he’d been in only a short few weeks before. Wasn’t that with her worth more than any of this?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How it felt with her… I’ve never felt with anyone else. Same as embracing the pillow feeling first as a child…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As if throwing it in $er face, Cat had laid it out.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I want a man.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

No more makeup and… being… becoming prettier. Having to be and call $erself a man.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Being fucking called ‘sir’ and shit…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although $he was more able to say no to this now, it didn’t remove the pull and sting of wanting to run back to safety.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Was $he entering the dark world? Is the Chinese Tune right?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All of the sudden $he was viscerally aware of the feeling of multiple barbed knives sunk into $er in opposing directions. Each one with any movement would cut further - whether moving from or toward.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Hormones. Surgery. Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Integrity. Expression. Love.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he sat still. Almost not breathing because any more than the minimum was unbearable should it cause the knives to dig deeper.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Life had paralyzed $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had been paralyzed for years. Each day requiring a smaller and smaller world which permitted $er to maintain the brittle illusion of who $he was, if only to $erself as $er inner self-knowledge grew. And the world saw seemingly no more or less of something $he was not. $he knew there were all kinds of people, transgender, queer, every possible sexual orientation and so much diversity. But $er foot wasn’t in the pool. $he hardly knew where the pool was. Or even if so, how to do it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And certainly not swim._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To be myself, through apparent violence and have integrity but the loss of all hope of my core dream._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It wasn’t about accepting femininity or trans-ness. It was about an irreconcilabe duality in $erself between $er gender expression and romantic identity. And without the knife could there ever be a chance at reconciliation.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Or to stop the train and get off, all the dreams intact. Under the condition of being a man. With the intent cutting off of something in $er that that seemed not willing to be dominated ever.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not to date._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not without someone to help figure $er out. $he knew well too, that’s where ten years and probably $100k had gone. The house most people would have purchased in their thirties sat with $er and these fish in the form of barely remembered fifty-minute sessions, completely impotent.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As $er ass with little padding tired of sitting on the boards, the hope of another way, one $he had never considered or believed in sprouted in $er heart like an angel of light. $he had no idea what that was, but maybe there was.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe I’ll be able to find it… decide it here._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Once and for all._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But surrendering to the feeling of being pinned down, feeling it to the core, admitting to it here in front of this little brook, it seemed to have loosened the anxiety and terror of $er situation and of the Chinese Tune.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After who knows how long, $he raised herself and made $er way on. A few minutes later $he reached the actual front of the resort, where $he was in fact greeted by a standing, smiling professional and welcoming Thai staff woman.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali had a bit of an ironic smirk on $er face, as was $er playful character with $erself, even in adversity. Not to mention whatever the tears with the fish had made of $er face, expression and eyes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Which of the smiles is that??!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_T_he hostess could not figure out this strange farang. Maybe he??? was not American.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_“Some ‘open soul’”_, Mali thought as if in unison with the clerk.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

On the wall there was a gold monogrammed saying:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cut yourself some slack.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Remember, one hundred years from now,&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_All new people._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The pretty and polite Thai woman smiled and offered Mali the key to $er room.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_‘What kind of foreigner?’_ the woman wondered.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

‘Just _what kind of hotel is this?’_ Mali wondered back.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali walked away in a kind of sad stupor.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This is what I’m doing with my hundred years._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not to love someone but…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali broke to the real tears again as $he made $er way down the solitary path to find $er abode, knowing $he was truly alone.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_With this precious and fragile gift that I’ve been handed.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This never-to-repeat precious day, these heartbeats, this breath.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This force of life in me that makes me alive and here.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_These feelings that never get touched or felt with someone else._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_All this fucking vanity.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What was any of it but a fucking self-indulgent turmoil-quest?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As $he climbed to her top level, second floor suite, all the holding of who knows how long crescendoed and tears turned to sobs and full catharsis toward what in feeling seemed to be _the bottom_.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was perfect.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was no one around to hear.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Much less care._
