Cat sat on the sofa passively staring out the window as the minutes passed by. There was of course all that had passed with Mali, and that of course needed attention. But she was inclined elsewhere. She felt kind of cold to push Mali out, but she was glad $he had left. She was feeling suffocated.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But then, the sexual opening and release in her pelvis. It felt like an elastic band had been cut inside her. Something in her now felt more open, out and exposed. Sexily exposed. Longingly exposed. With all her heart involved.&nbsp;Yet none of this seemed to tie back particularly to Mali or wanting this again with $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_You'd think..._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And over and over as the sensations, emotions and thoughts passed through her, was a building desire kindled by the freedom she felt the night before.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But could Mali be a man and this just be the way we love together?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She wondered even if that was the case that rock-star Mali could be a stable thing to the outside world and to $erself, could _she_ handle it? She too against that wall in the shadows felt a female against her and it turned her on more than anything she’d ever conceived.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That was probably the most disturbing thought.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She’d already mental-erased the Koona part of her final rapture in ecstasy.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Yet without remembering this, her mind then turned to Koona. If one thing was sure, she owed her an apology.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Yes, Cat, just an apology.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All of sudden she remembered. It was definitely an inconvenient vision that broke into her being last night as she came. She now recalled it in the daylight. Though it was disharmonious, she knew better than to put it back and deny it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But it could mean anything, right? People have all kinds of fantasies and imaginations. It doesn't make them real or important to fulfill, right?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat thought about her estranged friend. About her seemingly liking her… _that way_. From which she assumed meant Koona liked women. Previously there had been something shocking to her about it. Something so progressive, worldly and sophisticated. It had scared her a bit but she did not know why.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Yet now, it didn’t seem so crazy after all. Almost comforting. In fact, now that the whole topic was personalized — at least in a way — it was fascinating and she wanted to hear Koona’s story at least.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She smiled warmly for the first time today thinking of the fun she and Koona had had those last days they were together. Just like all the times before that, together, sitting, loosing track of time, talking about things, listening intently to her friends words which were always so real and perceptive. Oh, and laughing together. She really wanted that again and hoped it wasn’t too late.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat sighed as she rose from her mudra of contemplation.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But before that, I need time.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To get back to life, restore a sense of normalcy.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Readjust. Then see._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So although she often laughed at her own culture for so easily doing away with the uncomfortable, winging away to ‘just being’, as if whatever had happened wasn’t really here and now anymore, for today she’d invoke the tool. Some farang had written a book and coined the term 'mental erase' and it caught like wildfire among the expat communities something that was just prior an unnamed coping mechanism.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She smirked.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She would put out of mind completely what had happened with Mali and all these other confusing thoughts. For now.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Move forward, make something else of the day._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As such was one of the most remarkable yet shocking aspects of her culture. But, then again, it was part of what makes the Thai people and the country so strong and resilient.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And even happier. What's the value of problems and worry anyway?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

Mali laid on $er yoga mat as $he contemplated things, stretching and twisting her body. It was true, how much there was to unpack and process from last night. Most of her mind since leaving Cat’s was on the alluring sparkle of some new possibility in $erself, regardless of Cat’s continued romantic interest or even friendship.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he re-lived the first or many times the feeling of being held against the wall by Cat. As $he relived it viscerally, $er body felt more together, more aligned and solid. More $erself. It felt to Mali like confidence and self-esteem. If $he were really a man, that would be the last thing one would think would bring such - being taken, drilled into, penetrated, dominated, surrendering.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What made it such a turn on and so attractive was that it was Cat, with all her beauty, her tight body, but not just that, the secret sauce was her kindness and warmth, and that they had mental and emotional intimacy.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Her strength.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali needed more of that. Anytime, anywhere. This was the way that got inside, key in lock.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Would she ‘be a man’ in the world if it meant having Cat? Like this? Over and over?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fuck,” the word drawled out of $er lips as the reality of the situational setup between them now became clear, and $he collapsed back on the mat letting go of $er stretch.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Just like what would probably show to be the romantic gender taste difference between them, the only thing in common between her hotel room and Cat’s apartment was that they were mostly white, clean and a place to sleep. It was - had been - comfortable enough for Mali. Before last night it had been a luxury for $er to sleep here under the nice comforter in an air conditioned room.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat’s apartment was like being in a little corner of heaven, thought Mali, and chuckling, that it was high enough in the sky for it to be a plausible theory.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he looked around $er room.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Compared… this is ghetto._ &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe it was a portal, the whole thing yesterday, last night, the apartment, an alternate reality to realities. Maybe this is a dream still.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If I never hear from Cat again in time I know I’ll doubt if it ever happened._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Still laying on her mat in $er underwear, $he pinched $erself and it seemed to hurt.
