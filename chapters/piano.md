Today $he would remember to stay relaxed as $he played, just feel and stay in the present. Sometimes, well almost always in the past $he played to $er liking but ended up tense. Although $he felt good about what $he was improvising, $er body reminded $er that $he wasn’t completely relaxed, maybe not completely authentic, trying to please perhaps or simply self-conscious.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he knew that was not necessary. Just like with women. Things could feel so good and right, yet engaging, connecting, getting closer to loving, $he could feel the tension and some sort of discord build. Something did not fit, regardless of $er sentiments, as a man moving toward _this_ with _her_.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he struck a simple low C with $er left hand and a major 9th chord with $er right. Simple but the 9<sup>th</sup> adding a dash of emotional foreshadow. The piano was perfectly tuned, the keys were in precise mechanical shape. The black shiny piano was not only playable, it was potentially heaven.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As was $er style, $he just intuitively moved from chord to chord, slowly, not playing the next until $he heard it first inside - actually felt it - and knew its harmonic function which would give $er the relation in the actual scale $he was in, which was easy right now because $he was in the key of C. $he tended to stay in certain scales because $er hands and muscles were almost auto-tuned to translate what $he heard and felt inside into the feeling it took to execute the sound with $er body.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That_ was what it was all about for $er. Not the mind, just a feeling, almost bypassing the mind, from the internal feeling, the longing, through to $er arms and hands and out into harmonies. Almost a passionate aggression. Not angry, but insistent. Knowing. Knowing of all things of passion, what $he liked and did not like were always clear in music. It was one of those things - musical taste - $he just _knew_ without anyone telling $er. Same with fashion, same with taste in women.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If only I was so clear on ME._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The sounds, the feelings evoked with each execution of $er hands, all that was so hard to find reciprocated in day to day life. As if the tones and the somatic feeling which produced them made $er relate to how $he wanted to touch and be touched by _her._ The only other thing in $er life that resembled this was how $he was with $er hula hoop, also powered by music on $er iPod.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What $he did not consciously realize other than knowing $er passion for it, is that the piano and $er own unique way of playing it, really becoming one with it was the third instance in $er life of $er way of knowing — somatic knowing. $er body, muscles connected to $er emotions, nervous system and brain, in that order. To know what things were.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The first was the feminine sense in $er pelvis and sacrum. The one $he still held in doubt because everything around $er had told $er to do so. And the second, maybe equally early in life than the first, was _the embrace_ $he longed for.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In theory love and sex should have been somatically understood and driven too, but every connection and relationship $he had had went a step further beating out of $er the once-upon-a-time _knowing_. Which was the most disappointing thing on top of all in $er past relationships - that females from whom ‘he’ expected high levels of sensitivity and intimacy, seemed far from it, even less sensitive than $er own innate senses and longings.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So in the past especially, the piano was of coming home for $er. $er lifeline to $er tenuous inner true self and without it, who knows where $he’d be in life. And from music sprouted dance. And from dance sprouted expression of femininity and authentic movement in $er body. Maybe femininity came first but in $er it had to find a path out perhaps.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Hoop-dancing had taken over playing the piano for $er. With the piano it was $er heart channeled into $er hands and fingers. With hooping, it was further, the music $he heard channeling to $er whole body, even soul. Where in the past the offering of music was a way to express how $he felt inside to someone, but now in dance, it wasn’t an offering to anyone as much as an embodiment.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not_ **_for_** _her.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Because in dance I am her._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Whenever $he decided to be a ‘man’ again, $he would always fall back to playing music as an outlet, piano, flute, drums, whatever because the embodiment was proscribed in that role. But now, the embodiment $he’d reached through hoop-dance, it was $er, who $he was. It still - and had been engrained into $er from past teachers and therapists - that this was really selfish.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_“You’re supposed to only care about discerning and feeling your woman’s emotions, she does not care about your emotions. No woman wants a man whose feelings are equal or primary to her own. Biology makes us that way.”_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Well, fuck you too then._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was one of those things that made $er angry and bristle inside in male-female relationships, of how $he was ‘selfish’ for being aesthetic, wanting to look good, slender, sexy in a feminine way. It pissed $er off what $er girlfriends could do and wear but $he couldn’t. It had been a long time, but now $he remembered how upset this would make $er feel. Any any insisting on it at all was ‘wrong’, culturally emasculating and a felt embarrassment.&nbsp;When trying to be a man for someone.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The woman was the one who was to be the focus of $er attention. $he resented this imposed dynamic from the core of $er being.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As if today was witness of $er continued growth, $he did not tense. For some reason $he felt no pretension or need to please. Even with Cat sitting right next to $er. $he let the feeling and tears come. The longing for a love and closeness and as intimate as these 9th and altered 4th chords, of the play and changes, and the resolution, especially the IV chord over a V pedal, the sound of the most intimate union. To $er taste the dominant V chord was in so many cases just bare and vulgar compared. $er playing was never perfect but imperfectly perfect.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All $he really wanted was for someone else, another, to feel how $he felt, together with $er. Because it was so intense and deep. People did not understand sometimes when $he cried. They tried to stop or comfort $er. But $he loved the feeling of crying, it was like life and liberation, if there was a ‘water of life’ or holy grail, for $er it was crying. It softened and revitalized $er body like nothing else. Erasing the cage of tension $he lived in, albeit for some moments.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And the piano was an attempt at such communication.

$he checked in and Cat looked like $he was having a good time, eyes closed and comfortably leaning on her arm, leaning slightly toward $er. Deep inside Mali wanted and wondered. If Cat’s consciousness was placed inside $er own body, and $he in Cat’s. Or for that matter interchanged with anyone else. Would the feeling be familiar or of a different world of feeling?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

We have language to try to bridge understanding between people, and we have touch and senses to lessen the distance and make us think we are all alike. But to one person who gets transported to another - if it was indeed possible - would they find a prison or a palace? Would it seem familiar or foreign compared to ‘themselves’?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Do we feel ‘normal’ just because it’s what we’re used to? But if mystically transported to another we go from tension, doubt, despair and anger to humor, joy, gratitude and peace? Then whose ‘normal’ is really ‘normal’?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because even in $erself, through the secrets $he found about $er own body, $he could go from gridlock to expressive bliss in a matter of minutes. Just by changing how $he held $erself, paying attention to symmetry and balance in $er muscles $he became a different person.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Can anyone love so much to really be one so you feel everything together and the same way? Somehow $he trusted this as being possible regardless of what $he saw out in the world. A knowing not unlike the music itself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And if it was, this was the kind of place, this land of Cat and her family, the kind of world where it could happen.&nbsp;Maybe the only place.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

Cat sat even deeper in herself. Her head down, hands now in her lap, head tilted to the right, almost appearing asleep. She wanted more of what she felt in this music. This flow. She wished she could have Mali playing while she was falling asleep, it for sure would bring her to places in dream that were the best of where she would hope to ever go. The encompassing and warmth she longed for. Even in pain or death presence, these sounds would be light and hopeful.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was also confusing. This Mali. Rockstar or katoey Mali? So soft and gentle. Yet something very strong. Was it her being selfish that she wanted Mali to be a man? Could Mali be a he? He would be the perfect life partner if he was. The way they could talk. It really was effortless. Not unlike a best girl-friend. But then, was there more?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She found her thoughts on Koona. Poor Koona. Who had so many times been up here with her too. What had happened? So many years of friendship and now this void that apparently neither cared to bridge. A cloud came over her but the music insisted in her heart that she not hide from what she was feeling.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What was even stranger to her is that somehow, in Mali’s playing, the feeling reminding her of that last moment with Koona by the pool. Another cloud passed over her heart, this one more suffocating. Being with Mali was also rather familiar, it was kind of like being with Koona, but if she were a man. But then again, is Mali a man, right?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus Cat, mind-fucking are we?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Well, who knew but one thing she did know was that Mali was into her. And she was feeling things too but it was all so confusing and jumbled. Like since that night they walked in Chatuchak Park, this all was something in motion that she didn’t have control over but to go with it.&nbsp;Albeit a bit passively, waiting.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Well, too, it felt good.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like the last week with Koona.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That felt good too. As good.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Better even?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat made an unconscious nod.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Everything was always better with my best friend._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck…_
