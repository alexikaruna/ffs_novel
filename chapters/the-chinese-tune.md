<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The next morning Mali awoke to a tune from the building under construction next door. It was like $he had heard it before but couldn’t name it. Melancholic and droning, pulsing with a light tingle of bells and the melody of a flute, Asian - sounded Chinese - but with a western scale.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So beautiful it felt ominous.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was harmonious, shimmering and completely frightening.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Behind such beauty its effect made something hurt inside and hinted at something dark. Funeral beautiful but not death beautiful. It was overwhelming.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It made $er feel things…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like I’m in a movie. I’m that person you’re so glad you’re not...&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_… because they’ve made choices… it’s dark… they’re dying…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$er next thought was that the movie is not even real_._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he slapped $er cheek lightly as if to test for this.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Ok okay… not a dream, not a movie._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Ow._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But it was a song that could not be ignored without digging into what this feeling was exactly. For some reason it hit $er that maybe this melody was from the other side, the place where the psyche connects with everything beyond this life. And some in-between entity had written it down and performed it. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The place where consciousness meets…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The things that can be done to us… drugs, surgeries…_ w_hat you feel in moments before and after anesthesia.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Life bleeding away… close to the road. Approaching last moments. And at that point there's nothing you can do about it.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Every choice you’ve made leading up to this is in front of you.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe this song is a warning?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Because I’m was still alive, right now, hearing it.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I can change things. Take a different route.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The one of light.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not this one.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe I’ve mistaken its light for darkness?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Images of hospital rooms, needles, anesthetic masks and the dark sleep of the beyond during surgery came over $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A needle boring into $er forehead. In fact in the proposed surgery it was likely that $er forehead bone would be removed so it could be shaped and replaced.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It all felt malevolent.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And now with $er body so slender, could $he even survive such a procedure?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because that’s what was on the table should $he go this way.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m playing with my life._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m betting with my life.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Most of the time none of us feel how just close to the road things are for us. Just some blocked air or a puncture to an artery in a moment brings us close to the meeting of consciousness…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_With not._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Our biology, our life support. We take it for granted until…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It all goes wrong._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he turned over in bed, it seemed that sleep was likely over for the night.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Where am I? What am I doing?!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Was this the wrong way? The wrong choice?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Of course, deep inside, there was all the experience, knowledge and drive that had brought $er here. The same which was in set opposition to the mainstream world. The world of people who had told $er almost categorically that being gay is a lonely path and that being transgender is not real, just an element of play.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That being a man or woman - being true to your birth biology is ‘where its at’ for happiness. That one’s stress response is innately built-in, either masculine or feminine.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And these things… I’m doing, contemplating…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Are permanent.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he remembered $er last breakup before heading down this path of attempted self-knowledge and acceptance. It all felt like an alternative path then, to break up, a choice. Even as it was happening, it felt like a major switch in the code of $er life. An alternative to something more wholesome and right.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But completely and unacceptably boring._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Staying as it was.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Itself its own death._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Yet life and $er own body had brought $er to that breakup. And as with the relationship, the same here.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Looking around, the room which before had been dark, subdued but relaxing and cooling $he could now see - imagine - as the place of a cold, dark, lonely departure from this world.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Even the building itself could have been a hospital before. Who might have passed through this room?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Is this what $he would come to? Would $he remember _this moment_ when the end was imminent and realize it was in fact folly, and feel the pain of knowing $he had known?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Wrong choice? A fatal one?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All the heart, the dreams, the love, desire, the tears, $er body, its cells, organs and magic, all reduced to nothing by the outcome of this choice?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Tears welled up and started to fall.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he pulled up the eye scarf $he slept with around $er head. It would be so perfectly fitting. So fitting $he became afraid of it. Not conscious but deep inside $he knew of a vision, path and inertia that $he’d never had a whole lot of control over. The same which brought $er here.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Its what $he had always run from since childhood. Running from the darkness. From that fucking goddam San Francisco fog. As if it was one and the same as the darkness $he saw there as a child in the 80’s at the height of the AIDS epidemic. The _alternative lifestyles._ It seemed all dark to $er. B&D, S&M, gay, transsexuals.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All that, dark dark dark.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As an innocent child the feeling was sadness, darkness and isolation. Desolation.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I know my heart._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_My heart is not an alternative heart.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_My longings and dreams are not the ‘B’ side.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A thirsting heart. A searching heart.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The same heart in $er as a child holding a pillow in embrace feeling a beautiful girl with $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The same heart that longs for…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The primary dream._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A heart that could love, connect, merge, some way, some how.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What the fuck am I doing?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But $he _was doing_ and $er own heart was doing it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As $he walked out from the apartment building to the road, the fact was Mali must have looked strange. Coupling how $he already presented normally, with the fact that $he was more out of sorts than in a long time.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Weird energy._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had dressed as $he meditated on the Chinese Tune that still droned on like a malevolent zombie that would just not die.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the mirror the body of a runway model. A female runway model. Thats how more than one past girlfriend described ‘his’ potential. At least from the chest down.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus… neck down is just fine. Fuck breasts. Don’t care._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he liked $er body, slender as it was. Actually loved it. Despite all this fear instilled by the Chinese Tune, images of that woman in the magazine with a slender waist and toned belly like $ers and the likeness of faces.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_With surgery.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like that._ Just like that.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_AND so fucking vein.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So much money._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_All the risks._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But congruent.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_For once…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_…in my life.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was compelling. Even in spite of the death-wish wakeup call…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Putting on makeup did not make $er sad today like it had the past few. It had then felt like a burden. A reminder of how self absorbed $he had become. But today, makeup at least brought $er intermediate being into closer harmony. $he felt better with it. At least reducing being misread.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he evaluated that today $he was pretty. $he knew $he had a lot of masculine still on many fronts but this inner person was more and more real despite the warnings of a possibly crumbling facade from that fucking song.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Moisturizer, sunblock, some soft and nice smelling foundation, powder, bronzer, eyes…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Many times $he asked $erself how in the world it got to this point from ‘his’ past ability to wake, be in and out of the bathroom and outside in five minutes. It was not a lie that $he missed such simplicity. But then again, $er entire life had acutely diverged from such over the last few years and more even in the last six months.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And here we have… Mali in… the new normal…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Dressed in sleek yoga pants, a tank top, brown Converses accessorized by sparkling earrings, a rose quartz bead bracelet, $er favorite aqua colored onyx studded Japanese ring, plus computer backpack, $he made it out, and sooner than usual was able to hail a tuk-tuk.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And requested a ride to the Central Chiang Rai mall, pronouncing it ‘Centroo Chiang Rai’ to make sure $he was understood by the driver.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Staring out at the passing scenery from the back of the vehicle, Mali mentally prepared $erself for the mall. $he had often left that place in an agitated and angry state and willed today to be different, remembering the visit from a couple days ago…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Maybe half or more of everyone who walked by was looking at $er it seemed. Every lingering look. It was always like this. $he’d often start out in good spirits and resilient, smiling. And then it would just go to hell over time.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Feeling at the whim of the world.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Hearing over and over the words ‘farang’ and ‘katoey’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And then often the fucking laughter.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Even seeing the people as they made these comments._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The passers-by who were not already satisfied would continue to look back once or twice, maybe three times after they passed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_As if I don’t exist.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_As if I don’t have feelings.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_As if I’m an inanimate object to those fuckers._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or they know I have feelings and want a reaction.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Over $er lifetime $he’d learned to avoid showing $er feelings and reactions&nbsp; in public just for that reason.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The mall. Like being in second grade. Insecure and picked on.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To not let them see me cry._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Yet here…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I live in a foreign country on my own volition.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I came here and I can leave when I like and go more or less wherever else I like in the world.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I make more money in a day than perhaps many of these people do in weeks or a month.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_There might be no one I’ve ever come in contact with in all of Thailand that can match me at coding and analytical abilities.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And what the hell, I’ve been in the arms of one of the most beautiful women in Thailand.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So, Mali, what are you concerned about?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It wasn’t even $er style to look down on people. It was only especially in the recent years when $he realized how much others would capitalize on $er being different that $he started to adjust $er openness and caring for people.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When $he was calm and really in $erself, how $he loved life and to see people. Feel them really. Associate to them. Almost like $he was them. Their beings, feelings, aliveness. Each one’s joy, dreams, longings and good intentions.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But when it got to the point of feeling constantly poked at, she simply felt angry, even violent. Hated them. Frustrated. Feeling tense and resultantly kludgey, ungraceful and frankly, ugly. And since starting the overt gender exploration years, the hurtful experiences unfortunately eclipsed the positive ones, at least in $er primal brain which was wired for just such protection.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So eventually with enough instances $he shut down in large part to anyone $he did not know. To smile at a woman and be open, only to be stared back, even sometimes with that look of fear in their eyes. Or an initial smile quickly becoming a frown. Which $he assumed meant $he had been ‘read’ and rejected.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No more. The door is shut._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Or the dealbreaker being men. Especially if they were a group where any eye contact or even a nod would in a moment prompt audible comments if not all out laughter. It was only in the last few months that $he’d allowed $erself the luxury of ignoring men completely in passing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No more fucking men.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Thank god I’m not attracted to them.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But $he still had to deal with the atmosphere around $er, like it or not.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Thailand had at first held a lot of promise, and even now was still a much softer place than many. But it had it’s own way of dealing with foreigners, much less katoey ones. And where $he had hoped that $he would have been able to become part of the Thai-katoey friendship culture, one of the hardest hit realities was that no matter who you were, foreigners always seemed on the outside here.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Unless you want to be a walking ATM machine._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The one notable exception having been Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although $he was sure there were worse things to be, katoey farang seemed pretty low in the pecking order in terms of how a good portion of the public felt entitled to treating you. Well, unless of course you were in their store spending money.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This of course did nothing to help with the wound inside that $he, for $er lifetime had been desperate to sooth. And the old patterns of rigidity, anxiety, coalescing into what could appear as conceit, aloofness or simply shyness held.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The result was frustration and anger that always seemed just under the surface in $er. And it was one and the same which diminished the joy and feminine feeling in $erself. So it was a vicious circle - $er defense to ‘hurt back’ itself made $er less $erself.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

‘Sabai sabai’ was what the Thai used to describe a happy no-worries lifestyle. One of the reasons so many foreigners flocked there - the weather was warm, the people were overall chill and you could live on a fraction of what it cost to live anywhere else. It was attractive…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If you’re a cisgender heterosexual man… or maybe a gay man._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But on the other side of things, $he was constantly stared at. Things were said $he sometimes understood but often was unsure of. So there was all that, and too, the chasm between Thai and foreigner - as they called them, ‘farang’ - became clearer. ‘Farang’ originally had meant ‘barbarian’ although the term was used colloquially now. And under all the smiles there seemed to be unknowability.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Almost dehumanization… at least of others… my emotions._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But all in all, even if $he was in fact laughed at here, $he felt safe. Unlike in $er own country. At the end of the day, $he felt both from contact and intuition, that the Thai people were generally sensitive and kind at heart although in moments they could at least in appearance be the biggest assholes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And it’s hard to put on a real smile when you don’t feel good about even the smile itself and the face that depicts it. It’s hard to be with others… or even be yourself to yourself… when you don’t really know who you are.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And it’s hard when the overall feedback projected back seems to be that something is wrong with you._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But nevertheless, as $he entered Central Chiang Rai today, $he put on the smile $he had. Because if nothing else it was an emollient to $er own edgy nervous system… as long as $he could make it last.
