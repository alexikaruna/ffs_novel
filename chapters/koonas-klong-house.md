“Seriously Koona?” exclaimed a wide-eyed Cat, as the cab stopped in a very working class neighborhood, almost ghetto. It was a long way from Koona’s previous plush condo towering Ploen Chit.

“Well I like it”, Koona vocalized sassily, “Just check it out,” she smirked as she handed the driver full fare and a nice tip, a habit she’d picked up from the farang.

They walked on the dimly lit path alongside the flat one story building which housed several in-line apartments.&nbsp;

“Wow,” Cat murmured looking to the right upon hearing the soft murmur of free water, realizing that they were at the edge of a klong.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Hold on, you’ll see.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona softly put her arm around Cat to stop and guide her to the front door. She paused for a second and looked over at Cat, their eyes meeting softly, questioning eyes on both sides. Koona smiled shyly. She was having trouble making sure this was really happening.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or what was happening._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She’d be damned if there were not at least mixed signals. Or she herself was going mad.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Equally possible._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

She opened the door and ushered Cat in with her hand falling down her arm with a gentle tug on a soft receptive hand when reached. Koona switched on some very subtle track lighting which exposed a mostly rustic style studio. Immaculately clean and simply furnished, different shades of wood were the overall visual. A well equipped kitchen at the far back, a bed with all white linen on top of a wood box frame mostly behind a Japanese panel, a beautiful white plush couch just to the right and in front of them facing the front window, which she imagined if was not covered with a closed slatted wooden shade that it would look right out on the klong given that this was the last unit in the row. All darks, wood and mahogany color accented with plush whites and some black surfaces like the kitchen counter and the dining table.&nbsp;

It was perfect. Cat felt it. Even the smell had a slight musky smell of cedar.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Woooowwwwww” Cat intoned, “I love this, I really do!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I told you! Really, I needed a change, I had this vision and I found it,” Koona waited as Cat seemed to finish her admiring, “Do you want to sit down?” she motioned to the couch, “Something to drink?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smiled, “Yes. And water. Definitely water. I’m so thirsty,” but her eyes, the way she was looking at her, Koona’s heart filled with warmth and involuntarily connected to the ever longing sensation in her core.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Thirsty for what really are you?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus Koona._
