Heading out of the air-conditioned Sukhumvit ‘Times Square’ building, the sweet warm humidity of the Bangkok evening hit Mali. $he smiled. This felt good. The class, the little camaraderie with the other expats. Even the Chicago guy seemed okay in the end. There was something fulfilling about being social, even frivolously social $he had never really ever enjoyed before in $er life.&nbsp;

It wasn’t lost on $er that this was also the first time $er felt gender had ever been affirmed publicly. It was strange as $he never felt okay to ask for this or state it $erself. But given the choice of ‘ka’ or ‘krup’ $he knew which one $he was more of.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And here I get to choose…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m a katoey here. Ladyboy. Transgender woman._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m seen.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_First a katoey. Not a gay guy. Not a drag queen. Not a ‘man in a dress’.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m defined as something…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_At least more like I feel I am._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It doesn’t even matter what I look like._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That was something $he’d absorbed from the various Thai katoey movies $he’d watched in $er first time in Thailand the year before. The pride and absolute disregard for the haters but for the own femininity and self-regard of even the most masculine appearing katoey. It was amazing. Anyone, $he saw, could be fabulous… and just themselves…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_For the choosing. &nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It had been two months since $er breakdown back in that SF apartment and the resulting decision to come back to Thailand. For hope. To progress. Steps which seemed far too difficult and scary back in the United States. Bangkok felt a world away from San Francisco. It did not have that dark energy. It was more like a hybrid between urban Mexico and NYC.&nbsp;

Walking down the steps of the Asok MRT subway station, $he felt just a little more $erself, more authentic. A little proud even. Proud was not a familiar feeling to Mali, so a little was a lot. With a slender one-hundred-thirty pound dancers frame, only that $er face was so much masculine, in a European-type way, long, oval with big lips, pronounced cheek-bones. Always a target for the gay men throughout $er life, making things ever more complicated in the social world.&nbsp;

_I do wonder how Cat sees me.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

One inconvenient fact was the Thai culture seemed to regard katoey as only being romantically and sexually interested in men, and of course that was a problem. Cat was the receptionist at the beauty clinic $he was going to for $er ongoing laser facial hair removal. On whom $he’d developed an enigmatic crush.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Would I drop the fem and be a guy if she was into me?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Would she be the one who is so special that it overrides all of this?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was not a new thought for $er - that the perfect woman, ‘the one’ could fix this that ailed $er, but before it had always been a hypothetical question while the fem train $he was on continued it’s seemingly wayward journey. But now… the problem was embodied in a real woman.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was _that_ attractive to $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The perfect woman._
