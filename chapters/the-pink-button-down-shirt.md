**That evening…**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What was I thinking?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was staring at her date again.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Friend? Date.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No. Nooooooo!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Friend.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Date. I was the one who asked…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Her deep brown eyes and impeccable Japanese poise veiled the internal conversation expertly, adding to the already unknowable mastery of her Thai birth culture.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But that night… &nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What is anything?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It’s frying my brain._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This and everything surrounding the situation. She had missed Mali enough to call, in the hopes to see. If the friend, the time together, the _before could be…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But now?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I wanted _that_ Mali to show up. I miss - uh…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Him._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The hope HE represented.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Future boyfriend. A ‘yes’, at least a ‘maybe’ instead of a…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No way.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Regardless of how easy and perfect they were together, there was something more than that. Something that had been on her mind ever since the night the dam broke.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_With HIM I could make sense…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Of me. Of how I am._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Having a man with her. Not any man, but a man _like that_ made her feel like she was okay inside too. Secure and safe.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A chance. And the connection…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It reminded her so much of how it had felt with her best friend, like it had been with Koona, transparent, natural.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I want more. More connection, fun, and of course love.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And a man.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And what happened in the bedroom?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cats breath caught at the thought as it always did since that night a few weeks back.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Well, at least up to that point._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She had still not come to grips with who she’d become there either.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But that’s beside the point. It’s fine if it’s just in the bedroom.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But it wasn’t just the act and she knew it. It was what inspired it, triggered a desire and abandon she’d never known. She had hoped Mali would come back as the rock-star she’d projected on ‘him’ when they had met and first gotten to know each other. A guy who could be that and love with her the way they had been _that night_.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That’s the point!_ _But this is not who $he is._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The person sitting in front of her confirmed it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Heck, I even encouraged this!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although she wanted to kick herself even for perhaps inspiring Mali to go further in embracing $er femininity, she knew how selfish that was and recoiled inside against her own thought.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She took a deep breath as the realization settled.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I can’t do this.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_There’s a reason I stayed away and felt so confused.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I should have listened to that.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When Mali had walked in a few minutes late Cat had watched $er approach from afar. At first her eyes caught at Mali’s hips in $er fitted blue jeans. Then $er lower back, smaller, gracefully muscled and more slender than many women… that perfect ass. $he reminded her of the dancer woman in the movie _The Black Swan._ She had admitted to herself that although Mali’s face was masculine, $er body, especially that ass, exuded an energy that felt female.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s long legs one in front of the other, perfectly aligned feet-knees-hips-ribs, graceful and not even trying. It wasn’t a show, it was what $he was. Not to mention the energy and feeling that came from $er…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And what was between those legs…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Being with Mali had been nothing like being with a man. But it was the same that had put her over the edge that night… that feeling… that tight body. Female energy against her. It was intoxicating. And really all about why she, after everything, had suggested Mali come tonight.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In rapid succession Koona came to mind. She’d never thought about it but Koona was tall too…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I don’t understand it but I want more.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Of something.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I thought it was this. But that shirt…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The pink button-down shirt was tied at Mali’s thin waist. Tight blue jeans and combat boots. Five centimeter silver sliver pendant earrings, add to that makeup that was… over the top just enough to be questionably theatrical and not flattering.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

From the neck down perhaps… a country type.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

From the neck up… uh… flamboyant? Is that the word?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The combination of the two being fine aside that they created the illusion of what…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Neither wanted._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She did not know how Mali could have made it all the way from Chatuchak on the MRT without being stared at constantly by the not to mention hovering gay men.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It’s not that $he looked bad.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But toggle a tight black tank top and pull the faders down on the makeup and voila…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

You have rock-star Mali!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She made her way to Mali’s face and lost the illusion.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What we’re you expecting here Cat?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The girl she saw in the body she did not see above $er shoulders. The intensity of the night they’d shared mostly in the shadows clearly had created some projection and transference. She’d begun to desire something more…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But this isn’t it. I know now.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With the initial ‘hi’ from Mali, she realized, in the way Mali smiled and how $he talked that Mali had a way to go even to accept $erself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_$he’s not all female. Not yet at least. I don’t see it in $er eyes._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat caught herself in the thought.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_As if you’re looking for a woman, Cat?!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The problem was, the extra feminization Mali attempted out of anxious anticipation of this evening did nothing in the service of the felt inner being $he was so desperately trying to exude.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali couldn’t see it right now but one day would recoil. Given $he had been on the way to see Cat, it was true, $he conveniently deleted the looks of _every-gay-man_ in the MRT on the way here. Otherwise it would have been the case in point why $he dressed rather androgynously usually. Albeit assuredly in all female clothes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But Cat’s sudden communication and request which brought $er back to Bangkok today had electrified like a zap of lightning on a complex of wires every conflict and insecurity within $erself. _That night…_ the last time they’d seen each other… it was all fem. And initially everything that went beyond the friendship between them had happened and ended so fast that there was no time for insecurity.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But no longer…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he’d had to decide if this was this a date. Cat had disappeared for three weeks, not to mention their awkwardly painful goodbye. So in the end the result was a combination of “I don’t give a fuck” and “what the hell, let me go all out”.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So the image of who and what $he felt to be tonight won out over hard reality. As every female knows, dressing is for your body type, situation and the social context. Things Mali was not yet to the point of comprehending. And no true fault to $erself, in that, appearing female is a total sum of many things. But when you have only a few of the ingredients, the tendency is to overemphasize the ones you do have - both in accentuation and attempted masking. Only natural.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was true that $er face could never right now pass as female or close to it. What didn’t help was its muscle tone, the tightly wound tension was just in such contrast to the the effortless surrender that female faces seemed to have naturally, even in the toughest situations.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That and too, if it weren’t for $er rather forward, what $he judged as ‘turkey neck’, and the tension in $er chest and shoulders, $he might actually look elegant…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_‘Body of woman, face of man’_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was a phrase $he’d heard repeatedly over the years on the street, usually after the person had turned around to check. It never ceased to ricochet in $er brain amid the rest of $er confusion. It always was at least two or more people and the comment in ear sight, for whatever insensitive reason. The feeling of something being wrong with $er eclipsed the true hurt and sadness that the remarks left behind.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$er neck was one of those things $he knew $he could have control over. $er shoulders a bit wide and athletic for a woman and showed the struggle between them, $er neck and head for poise, the muscles and tendons of $er neck showing the fight against the exposure of $er Adams apple. $er standing practice helped this control, day by day.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$er facial features were pronounced from $er Jewish heritage - the way $er bone structure was and proportions. $er head and face were oval and compact more like a woman’s. But the features were male.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And as slender as $he was…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Hence the gay look._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The mirror was always a schizophrenic place for Mali, not to mention how to process the man-woman comments. As half of it was affirming, then the other a painful dysphoria.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A socially constructed shit sandwich._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The most painful part aside from constant self-evaluation and judgment was the feeling that how $he appeared to the world was so far from the nature of who $he felt to be inside.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was not that $he was adamant that $he was a woman. But that $he was at heart gentle and not an angry person, and that $he did not feel like a man. And the world seemed to see a rather serious man.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Albeit a rock-star._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_At least according to Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So in the end, $er face was the biggest barrier. To be that soft and gentle but with this face, it was unthinkable.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It felt so wrong. $he felt like $he always came off as…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Very very gay._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So $he’d created a kind of wall. In androgyny. Flirting on the edge of what felt right while using the roughness in $er tank top, jeans and combat boots to make sure anyone $he came across would get the message that $he meant business. Not a good target for ridicule.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Faux butch._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Bull-dyke._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although $he wanted to see this in $erself, there was not a bone in $er body with this kind of poker face.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And did it work?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not really._
