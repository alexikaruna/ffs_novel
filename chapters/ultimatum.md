The two were now sitting in a comfortable cafe-lounge. It was Friday night and conveniently, neither had other plans. Each professing no desire to do anything crazy or stay up late.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Let’s just go hang out, okay?” Koona had suggested at Cat’s unusual ambivalence in plans, apparently continuing her regular trips to the netherworld where she seemed to be spending more and more time lately.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe Cat has changed.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona too knew that she herself had changed a lot over the year lapse so gave it not more than a passing wonder.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sure, why not”, Cat wanted nothing more than to just be around Koona, ever since their reunion. Despite the fact that she was clearly having trouble keeping herself on planet earth.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So here they sat, in the dim lighted mostly wooden room of the cafe, each in a big wood framed chair with plush pillows, perpendicular to one another. Koona was staring out straight ahead, watching the passers by on the sidewalk strolling the Ari neighborhood, one of the more posh areas of Bangkok. It was like she was in a trance too . The couples conversation easily came and went all evening. Very dreamy.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now Cat was watching her, head turned to the side as she nursed her tea. Koona, sensing the attention, breaking her daze, turning back to Cat. Something in Cat would not let herself let go of the gaze. Their eyes locked and Cat smiled, holding the gaze still.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What?!” Koona intoned, raising a shoulder and smirk. She’d also wondered about the different feeling going on since the re-encounter, but neither was she going to make any kind of move.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I will not do that again. To myself or to Cat, to our friendship.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But she was enjoying it, lack of physical intimacy and sex aside, more than the company of any of the women she had been in the past year. The thought that she would even trade the sex for this anytime came to her. Fact was tonight she actually was, turning down yet another invitation from who now only seemed to be another flavor of the month.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona’s mouth dropped just perceptibly with Cat’s words, “you’re beautiful.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

At first her heart flushed with warmth and blushed. The same sending the love to other parts of her body, which she quickly ordered to behave nevertheless. But then she felt angry, not knowing why. She felt in a bind. Kind of ruining the chill flow of the evening.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m fucking tired of this._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because it now dawned on her that this whole week she was still hanging out, waiting for Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like in the past.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And we know how that ended._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She had been hurt badly by her own holding on.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Stupid._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They could be friends but she was not going to do this to herself again. Cat knew where she stood. Cat could do or say something if she wanted to.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And she hasn’t._ &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The fuck if that isn’t obvious now!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She felt the need to stand, the inner turmoil driving her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So she did.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Where are you going?” Cat felt jeopardy, disconnected, feeling a little hurt at the response.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I need some air,” and without eye contact, Koona walked out to the front of the cafe.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat took a deep breath and a minute later followed her friend out. She found Koona leaning one knee up and foot against the front wall, holding a lit cigarette casually in her dangling left hand as she looked the other direction, oblivious or avoiding Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Another piece of Koona 2.0?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

No matter how repulsed she was by smoking, something about Koona smoking was kind of sexy, much less, like that against the wall. It was tomboy-like and Cat found it extremely hot.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona spoke without looking at her or changing her focus which must have been on some faraway object straight ahead.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cat you might not want to hear this. But I’m your best fucking friend. Forever, right? Through everything. You know that. And you know what pisses me off the most? Really?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was speechless. Koona had never spoken so strongly to her. She shook her head, breathed in and held it, because one way or another she knew this was going to hurt.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat could see Koona’s eyebrows raise to the heavens, filling the gap which was to have been her own response.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fucking Mali. Why did you run to me to talk about him - her?” she paused, still staring directly ahead and making no eye contact, “And how in the fuck am I supposed to feel, you meet him - her - whatever - and you spend the night just like that?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She turned abruptly now eyeing Cat, intending laser fire projecting from her eyes to break through and break this all apart even if it meant total destruction of their friendship, so was the rage running through her.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat did not totally get where she was going. Did not want to, truth be told. She did not like this path.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And then Koona went in for what she thought was the final blow,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And you know me forever but wouldn’t even venture a kiss, instead you disappear for a whole year and show up because your confused about yourself,” and then going on a limb albeit one that felt very solid to her, “you know, if you don’t feel anything for me then fuck it. Just go away and stay away. I feel like you’re just toying with me. Probably how you toyed with Mali. Just like a Cat with a ball of yarn. I’m afraid that’s whats going to happen here. When you get bored or what you want you just run away. I’m sure that’s how Mali feels. Because you haven’t professed anything of substance or real feeling to me…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But she was not done. Cat retained her breath.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Look, I know you were hurt. I get it. It was bad. I get that too. But Cat you’re an adult now. Adults have to know themselves and try to get things right, you know?” Koona arched her brows in the rhetorical question stating the obvious.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You know, if you’re not into me then you should not be here hanging with me, you should be out with a guy or whoever you’re into. Fuck, it’s Friday night. And I should be with someone who is…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona slapped her forehead no-duh.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then a random thought hit her…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Is Cat infected with the Tom and Dee crap like everyone else Thai?_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Truth be told, that’s why she now stuck to foreign women.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Hmmm… But back to business at hand…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So you know what, make it fucking right Cat. Get clear with yourself what you are and what you aren’t, Jesus Christ…”, Koona was remembering Cat’s revelation, “Even take your time,” she paused as if gathering wood for the fire, “But no matter-fucking-what, go clear things up with Mali who I am sure feels right now like a piece of shit.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She actually really felt for Mali, simply because she knew what Mali had ahead to accept her own nature, from what Koona understood. Not to mention what dating would be like probably.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And if there’s anything left for you to say to me after you do all that, you know how to find me. But I’ve had enough. It hurts too fucking much and I’m not going to let you do this to me again. I’ve paid my dues this year. Go pay yours. Whatever the hell they are.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And with that Koona pushed away from the wall and stormed off into the rain.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat, having stored up some of her own hurt and frustration from the hard but truthful words yelled after her, “well you should cut your hair shorter and stop wearing makeup, so then at least I’d know where you stand!”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Of course with immediate regret.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat… jesus christ what’s wrong with you??? You like…_ **_more than like_** _how she is… as she is... and you fucking know it!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona stopped dead in her tracks and turned around as if in slow motion, a furrowed and questioning ‘what the fuck’ expression on her face.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I knew it!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The fucking Tom and Dee. &nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And for a split second her heart warmed as it at least meant Cat was thinking of something…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_More than nothing…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With her.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then she let it go and kept on walking, not looking back.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck it.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck this!_
