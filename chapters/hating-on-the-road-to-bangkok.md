The best day of my life is the day I am free to be myself as I am. The day that I have a smile wherever I go and laugh easily and often is a day lived at its fullest. I am complete. Game over, nothing else to seek. 

Mali had some years back penned these words into ‘his’ journal and still carried it, copying it to a new one when needed. It’s funny how it’s like we already know everything, the real end answer but we need help getting there.

Of course everyday is beautiful when you’re right with yourself. 

But I’m still hardly right with myself.

Six in the morning was also a beautiful time to walk in Chiang Rai. It was cool(er), tranquil and allowed one to savor the beauty - which was plentiful though easy to overlook when the sun reached in at the heat of the day. 

Given there was not much chance for finding a cab anywhere near the apartment building, $he started walking with $er small roller carry-on suitcase in tow.

Although it wasn’t in every moment, strangely since seeing The Face, $he felt empowered to be ‘fabulous’… it was just the word that embodied that feeling. Because before - or unless $he ever became a ‘she’ to the world - ‘fabulous’ was what $he would have to settle for. Even for $erself, at home, first came fabulous and then maybe maybe ‘she’. 

Gay or in my case… not.

$he noticed even just a difference in $er hips as $he walked. Not flamboyant or anything but just more…

Me

$he couldn’t put $er finger on it but something had broken - just more of the caring about what others thought was gone.

As a car announced its way by the engine, Mali could feel the usual tense-up $he’d feel - in the morning when $he expected to be alone. 

But it’s just because I hate myself… 

Mali reminded $erself. The anxiety subsided. Saying that seemed like such a negative thing… but in the days since The Face meeting, whenever $he reminded $erself of it, $he felt more okay, more free, and a smile would come easier. It was strange.

Tranquil roads. Turning the corner from $er street and soon walking over the little bridge across a small brook. The greenery always full and enthralling. It was truly beautiful this place. Too if one got to the third story or beyond of any building - then the surrounding mountains and majestic country could be seen. Only that savoring such beauty and its deliciousness was generally lost in the heat and intense sun, so it felt to $er.

In any other cooler climate, this place would be somewhere $he would explore, walk every street and alley, want to go find the base of the hills and see how far $he can go up them. So, it was walks like these in early mornings, rain or unusual cold spells that were so precious and was $er only ability to emotionally connect to the physical environment. Well, beside nighttime. 

No people on the street to stare, make remarks or laugh. Or just get in $er way, impeding $er path and progress, as it felt. That’s why $he liked the early morning. One didn’t have to be fabulous… or anything for that matter, have any confidence, sense of or belief in yourself or your value… if no one else was around it was a non-issue. $he often didn’t even know $he was in a bad mood until crossing paths with someone.

As $he made $er way, all of the sudden $he heard a door open and saw a woman a few houses ahead getting onto a moped. Damn, so much for being alone. As if it was a big deal, it was just how $he was when $he was expecting and wanting to be alone. Which was most of the time. 

It’s just that I hate myself.

Mali walked by pretending to not know anyone was around, but the woman said hi, and offered $er a ride on her moped as she was heading to the market. 

Mali immediately tensed up inside feeling bad, about how $he just had ignored the woman and wanted away from her. Fact was, $he didn’t want to be seen - or show $erself. 

I’m just sick of people staring at me, observing me, even laughing at me. That’s the whole story.

I hate myself. That’s what. The rest is bullshit. 

Mali reminded $erself again. 

$he smiled back at the woman, ‘kap koon ka, mai ao, chop dern na ka’. 

Thank you, but no thanks, I like to walk. 

She smiled in thanks again and went on her way. 

And that was the feeling $he so often had, like after such an interaction $he felt tense, pulling in inside, making $erself small in the view that someone was kind to $er. 

Because if you hate yourself, kindness is quite hard to take.

$he nodded. It made sense.

And $he hated the rigidity that was born from such turning in. $he’d never until now understood the mechanism. For most of $er life $he’d less than consciously blamed the world for $er problems.

Why couldn’t $he just be open, smile and love? And not give a damn what anyone else thought? 

I think everyone hates me. 

Everyone’s looking at me.

Laughing at me.

But really, its me who hates, looks and laughs at me. 

First and worse than anyone else.  

I beat them to it. 

In the mirror at home it starts.

$he continued to repeat it like a mantra as $he walked. Found a cab. Actually smiled and was friendly to the driver. And soon was aboard a plane destined for Bangkok.
