The two sat across from each other at the sun-swept kitchen counter-bar.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

At first to Mali as $he emerged from the bedroom, Cat was soft, quiet, shy. Coming to grips with the past hours, for both of them, now in the light of day, with a world below that still insisted on existing, it seemed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

How comforting and alienated the night had been from that. A night where no one else - nor culture nor rules nor their own complexes got their way. As if suspended.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A return to innocence._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Everything up to the point of orgasm had been amazing, and Mali emerged hopeful that $he had only been imagining what felt like a change in the dynamic between them - in the closeness - afterwards.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had passed through the bathroom, had already faced in the mirror the reflection of a person who was so much different from the woman $he had felt to be in Cat’s arms. That feeling still was more real than the reflection. $he wanted so much more of that ‘her’... and in connection with another.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Coming out to the kitchen Mali had thought for a moment - hoped - that today might mean spending the day together. And maybe more!&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Much more._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But as $he sat there in silence now, the moments passing, in front of Cat, it became clear something was up. Outside the day appeared cloudy which gave still the feeling of isolated togetherness. But Cat was unreadable.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She could hardly move. Being completely confused, knowing deep down why but _going there_ being too arduous a task, especially in front of Mali. So then settling for the default of feeling lost and deflated. Shutting off. There was none of the intensity that she’d penetrated Mali with only some hours ago. As allowing anything near that would bring up the whole thing she was not ready for.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As well, as if the clouds betraying Mali’s hope, a bright sun pierced through and made it known that today would be sunny. As with Cat’s mood, it hit with a harsh reality, along with the the distant sound of the road, horns — the everyday reality of Bangkok traffic.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Just as the world outside insisted on a continued existence, so did the the inner conflicts of each of them of which the night had been a well deserved vacation. Or exacerbation.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Reality felt wrong.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali wanted Cat to say something. But she didn’t. So $he searched for $er own words which also made themselves scarce. What had felt perhaps fragile last night now felt solid. As what had transpired - and even was now - at least to Mali, inevitable. It had only excavated what was already there.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was nothing like the future Cat had imagined for herself, even as recent as yesterday before Mali appeared unannounced at the clinic. Too, the reason she herself had not called Mali, as even before yesterday, after their day together in Chiang Mai, she was feeling confused about everything in relation to $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Also conflicted with the fact that she was astonished, speechless even, for being with a woman or someone who is like a woman - or turned into a woman in her embrace. And that she’d enjoyed it immensely. A little tingle of the way she came last night still lingered. If she wasn’t so twisted up in the head, she would have paid more attention to the fact that that she too wanted more, much more, feeling a depth in her sexuality and expression she had never experienced before.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali knew it had been the night $he’d dreamed of, longed for, Cat bridging $er seemingly eternal inner conflict. The fear that being who $he truly was would mean $he’d never have such a relationship with a woman. Cat had gotten through and deep. To be lovable by an amazing other. Filling the unconsciously empty void of how $he truly felt about $erself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now if Cat could only, in daylight still see inside $er! The prospect of which seemed to be dimming by the minute.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Once fluke, twice maybe, three times a pattern. The score was twice now in $er life the feeling of authentic loving and expression through $er feminine self. And zero for $er male persona.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So much for the perfect woman fixing me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Feeling - remembering - being so receptive to the woman in front of $er - and that that woman had aggressively taken $er was Mali’s comfort in these moments. $he loved Cat’s emotion, and in that $he’d take and roll with whatever she dished out, the good and the difficult. Because it felt good. Even now, just to be in her presence.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It felt sexy to sit here with her. Knowing how they had connected, this woman knowing and seeing who $he truly was and still wanting to be with $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Always avoided, always wrong in and to the world. Always wrong in the mirror. But once again, not in $er deepest expression, as last night testified.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They ate in silence the fruit, juice, croissants. And coffee for Cat, declined by Mali. There was no way $he needed caffeine or any other body-mind altering substance today.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he tried smiling, which came out weak and shy. Cat returned an equally disingenuous attempt.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s heart dropped. $he felt like crying. It was the saddest and most painful feeling. They had both gone into this with eyes wide open but neither was expecting what had actually transpired. Although in a way it felt inevitable between them on the course they had set.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Just a matter of time. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cat, are you okay?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he just wanted to hear something, anything, from Cat about what was going on before $he dug $erself deeper into this sadness.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smiled turning to a lump in her throat and a tear, shaking her head.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali I know nothing, I just know nothing. It was amazing, wonderful, perfect,” she looked down and shook her head, “But I don’t know anything. What to say. What to think. You go back to Chiang Rai tomorrow, right?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I have a ticket.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I think you should go,” Cat spoke slowly and deliberately. But the words hit Mali with the feeling that this was about leaving _now_, not about $er flight tomorrow. Cat smiled the _I’m smiling but am really dying inside_ smile. The beauty of the Thai culture showing through her, with a way to smile in practically every circumstance.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She added, softening what she knew had come out quite harshly, “I feel like a mess. It’s not about you. I just don’t know anything. Maybe I need time.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I need time.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To Mali ‘time’ meant ‘_no but I just don’t want to admit it right now_'.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The fact was Cat had made it clear that last night was just for the moment. Despite $er want of something else, Mali knew this and had agreed to it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he wanted to leave too now. The change in atmosphere hurt too much. Also because $he felt at the brink of throwing $erself and begging Cat to talk to $er. $he wished to let the clock back twelve hours and perpetually keep it there, in the world of no-promise togetherness.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded to $erself.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’ve never felt what I did last night. Regardless of what we said, my heart still hoped. Hopes. I think you reached my core. I am not sure I’ll ever be the same,” Mali returned the dying inside smile as the tears started.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he tried to voice how $he felt, “I…” But more words would not come, only tears.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat got up and came around to where Mali had started to stand and embraced $er, speaking tenderly with a tear in her eye.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know. Believe me,” she tightened Mali in her arms, for a moment returning $er to feeling the cherished stability and love in her arms, and for Cat, the connection she too deeply needed, “I am not sure I’ll ever be the same either. I’m just really confused now. I’m sorry.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She wished she even knew what those words meant in reality for her, but knew they were true.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I can’t help? We can’t talk about this?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With the visceral jerk $he felt from Cat $he knew the answer was negative and again wanted to get away in lieu of feeling further hurt. There was nothing else but to let go and give Cat her space. In $er own vulnerable state it was also self-protective and keep whatever dignity $he had.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali whispered as using $er voice any more would just lead to breaking into more tears.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I think I should go now,” as $he pushed back and was released from Cat’s arms.&nbsp;Breaking away felt empowering, albeit the last option of power $he had in the situation.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The clothes were on the bathroom counter.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Laundered and lovingly folded by Cat, who knows when. Was it thanks to the colluding rain, getting soaked that brought the two of them into this intimacy and heartbreak?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Seeing the clothes made her want to cry. The tight jeans and androgynous tank top. Black socks. Combat boots. They now symbolized everything wrong with $er, with $er life. They were women’s clothes, but to $er now, a uniform of insecurity, confusion and indecisiveness.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That in which $he met Cat the first time. A discordant set of attire given who $he had been last night. And too, an outfit that spoke volumes of $er relationship to Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They were unhappy clothes now to $er. The best these clothes could bring $er to was what had just happened. No further.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She took them, feeling them softer from Cat’s touch and care as $he ran her fingers over the rather coarse denim.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They even smelled good.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali knew better than to look back as Cat gently closed the door behind $er. $he heard the solid click of the lock into the well engineered frame.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Like everything in Cat’s life.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali felt sick.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What am I doing!!!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How can I leave???_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But there was nothing $he could say or do. The die were cast.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If I was a man, had been a man last night, maybe… I could turn around and make Cat know that I’ll be a guy if I can be with her._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he shuddered at the thought.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus Christ Mali!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

How fast $he’d turn and sell $erself out.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

No. $he would not change a thing about last night. It had been perfect. $he would focus on that, and how $he felt in Cat’s embrace until whatever needed working out did so.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because everything that Cat and $er had lived last night, and in the time they had known each other was all predicated upon her being $erself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Last night was the only time things have ever been real for me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And I’m not there yet in daily reality.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As $he walked away from the building and down the street, shaking $er head in disbelief once in a while. What was most ironic is that $he’d always imagined how being with the ‘perfect woman’ would play out. $he’d be able to be a man with the perfect woman. But last night it organically turned into just the opposite.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Everything that came out of $er naturally last night was $er feminine. It felt easy and right on. The polar opposite of $er encounters as a ‘man’. It was an easy, primal surrender. Just like the first and other time $he’d been _taken_.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Authentic.
