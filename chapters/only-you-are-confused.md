“No!” Cat screamed fanning her hand over the flaming shrimp stir fry. She laughed looking down at the smoking mass as it abated, “how about we order something?!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She pulled some menus from somewhere, and placed the disaster in the sink to cool off.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Here, take these, let’s sit on the couch and figure out what we want. I’ll bring the wine!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali took the menus and made way to the living room area at the other end of the room. The couch started on the side wall and curved around to the wall which ended at the hall entry. The walls backing each side of the couch were normal interior walls, but sitting on the couch in any position one had a comparable panoramic viewn of the city.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he sat down with Cat following, taking up a space not far on the other side of the couch curve.&nbsp; Still within reach of intimate conversation but not of physical reach.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Confirming _that path_ that Mali had glimpsed a few minutes before.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What looks good?” she asked.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m stumbling over the duck noodle soup. Can they bring that?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“This is downtown Bangkok, we can get any kind of food any time of day all days in the year, not to mention what else!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh, right.” Mali smirked.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay, so duck noodle soup for you. How about a second one, just in case? And for me, well I am going to ask for what I failed myself - stir fried shrimp and rice. Good?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Wonderful.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“To drink?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Anything but red soda.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Thai tea?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sure! Lets celebrate,” Mali didn’t drink caffeinated things past mid-afternoon but suspected that regardless, sleep would not come easily that night wherever $he ended up laying $er head which at the moment seemed increasingly uncertain.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Small talk ensued after Cats call in for the food. It would be thirty minutes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was not long before an atmosphere of sleepiness overcame them. From a full day of work for Cat and travel for Mali, the park adventure in all its facets and coming here, it was a lot. There was something about getting soaked in the rain and now warm and dry. It made for feeling cozy and protected.&nbsp;But it also felt to Mali like maybe the magic of the afternoon was ending as Cat seemed to also be in her own world.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s heavy eyes were sandy when the bell rang. Cat seemed more composed and sprung into action. Mali was shooed away while toddling to the door after her like a zombie with money in hand to offer.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Come on, I’m starving!”, Cat exclaimed, bringing the food in.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now a bit more refreshed, Mali, walking to the table saw $erself reflected in the window. $he felt good in that nightshirt and it did something for $er, accenting $er wider than male hips or was it $er slender waist? She nodded. It was not unlike a dress really, the way it held to $er figure.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This might need some further exploration._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had held dresses as off limits. $he’d not really thought about it, but they felt outside of $er tolerance for ridicule. With $er face the way it was. A man in a dress. That was the stereotypical image painted by $er culture for $er. Transgender, crossdresser, ‘tranny’, the haters didn’t give a shit. In Thailand it was different, but then again, Thai males more often than not tended to have very pretty faces. And the ‘faring katoey’ plus laughter thing was already enough for $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So wearing a dress felt similar to the problem of being a man with breasts. Or letting a girlfriend have anal sex with ‘him’. Just not really acceptable. $he’d rather be a cute guy in andro clothes than to look like a dude in a dress if those were the only choices. And at this juncture those were what was available to $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just not gay looking._ &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But the nightshirt worked. And this evening worked.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the day, $he’d pass as female if $he’d just cover $er head with a paper bag. This conflict, coupled with what felt like a growing intimate estrangement from Cat in the last half hour saddened $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Settling at the petite glass dining table positioned adjacent to the main window, they were quiet. The conflicted sadness that was building again in Mali, in counterpoint to the jubilation of feeling so free with Cat on the way over made $er want to cry.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The world below existed but continued about in silence.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Ravenous, they dug in to the meal and were quiet aside from random slurps, a series of ‘mmmmmm so good’s!’, and shared full mouthed smiles on both sides. The food and non-verbal communication revitalized Mali.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Finally beginning to feel satiated, Cat spoke.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So you’ve always liked girls, yeah?,” Cat made out between bites of bok choy as if it was something mundane.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_God, is this like a roller coaster??!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s hope returned like a hopeful puppy dog, strengthened by the fact that Cat had chosen to continue the topic.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah. That and transgender women. I mean, my life would be so much easier if I liked guys but I don’t. I mean, they're gross! Not that I didn’t try a couple times, it did nothing for me, if not repulsive.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat unlike many had already traversed the fact that a katoey could like women, not only men, in spite of the general choruses of ‘Thai ladyboy only like Thai man’. Only because she had worked through it with Kwan — the epiphany being that Kwan identified as a ‘kind of Tom’ but the more pretty version, and still a woman. Because Tom’s who were genetic women - in trans-speak almost seemed - like female-to-male transgender men, in appearance and etiquette.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was a mouthful to say the least, and as well for her to get her head around but she had.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’ve never been with another girl,” remarked Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Would you?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I think maybe.” It was at that moment that Cat noticed for the first time her own shift. As even a few weeks before she’d never have entertained the possibility.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What does this mean Cat?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What about Koona?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Koona is a woman._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She’d not yet revisited what happened with Koona in this new light.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Women, girls, for me have never been just a physical thing,” started Mali, “In fact maybe this is too much information but since puberty I became aware of having really two different types of orgasm - one like the typical male thrusting, penetrating and kind of strong physically. The other deep inside and often up to my heart, full of the feeling of union and connection. I did not call the second feminine then but it kind of is. It is through the body, all over.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Did it confuse you?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled ironically, “not until it did…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I just assumed that all boys were like me. Just like I assumed that they felt and wanted women in the same way. It took me years, even until recently to realize that I’m different or simply maybe more sensitive.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What do you mean?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, the sexual part aside, it turns me on and makes me feel so deeply to just be close and connected to someone I’m into. Soft, gentle. I don’t need the hard kissing and thrusting shit. It’s not my nature to dominate, feels kind of wrong or is hard to hold on to if I try. When a woman gets out of that gentle range with me - if they can get there at all - my energy turns off, sexually, emotionally, I withdraw.”, Mali described, “But on the other hand a transexual woman could take me, penetrate me, even strongly and it would totally turn me on. But in that case I am not really trying to be a man, I am in my female sexuality then. Totally.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he continued on a roll, “I mean, only in recent years I started looking around to see what women actually seemed to want from men, add that to my own proclivities, and so many times women I dated saying behind my back things like ‘I like him but he is so passive when he kisses’! It made me start to say ‘I don’t think this is what I signed up for!’”.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So you like to be passive? But with a female?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I guess you could say that. I mean I don’t think I truly mind being inside a woman, but not as a man. I think its being forced into such a role that doesn’t work. I could totally pin a woman to the wall and fuck her but only if I knew she saw me as a woman… that they’d always seen me as a woman.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat burst out laughing but then curbed it in.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sorry, I’m just listening to you. I think the only one who is confused about you is you!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But the depth of Cat’s perceptiveness was lost on Mali. Because $he was distracted with the desire for Cat to truly understand. And in it all, still truly want $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And maybe she can solve it once and for all._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali had been so blown away by everything with Cat that it didn’t phase $er to once again consider such a possibility…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Complete healing… of this…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I mean I dreamed of being with someone - this is how I thought all women would be like - and just gently being inside her, just holding her and feeling that connection. Very slow and gentle. Someone who… when were together… it feels complete. Thats the only way I can stay hard anyway - the second there is a disconnection in intimacy or the feeling of having to be in the mans role, it dies. All of it. I want away and to be alone. I don’t need the release, it goes away anyway.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I think I am starting to see,” Cat slowly and deliberately drawled. Fact was she already saw.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali added, having forgot something important to the big equation, “You know, I have never been with anyone in that way. Its just something that’s in my heart, in my being I guess. I guess it’s kind of sad. Sometimes I wonder if that’s why it feels so strong to me to be female in my expression. I wonder if I am creating the woman who I always searched for, just in myself because I can’t find her out in the world. Or because those out in the world…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_… like you want nothing to do with me.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Thats kind of deep. Do you really think? I mean, wouldn’t that be lying to yourself?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah, that would be it. That’s what I was saying earlier, I am so afraid of making bad decisions.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Now I see, the fence,” said Cat thoughtfully, “So if I was a woman who could be so soft and loving, it might be possible to achieve this?” she paused, “You would not have to be a girl… if your hypothesis is right?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And with that sentence Mali knew for sure that Cat grasped and had summed up $er entire obsession and complex.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Maybe.” If it hadn’t been for the last several years. Before that it would have been a resounding ‘yes’. And if it had been then, she’d never be here in Thailand sitting by the window in a 44th floor condo of a woman who seemed on the surface so far out of $er league.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I mean just what you described sounds amazing. In this world so many of us drop believing in such things, such closeness. But we all long for them from birth I think, if we are honest.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Do you think?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded, her eyes now magnetically fixed on Mali.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I don’t know why I don’t give up. I do sometimes. But then a person, a song or something beautiful, a feeling reminds me of what I long for and she’s still there. Just the way when the season changes or a way a day is will remind me of the ghost of longing that never departs in one.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But even with the thought of being a man and it working… for some reason sucked the energy from Mali.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To be able to be a man._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_… if I was healed…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But if anyone was capable of proving it, Cat was. And that was the poignant thing, on the cusp of the big decisions that were floating in $er mind and starting to materialize in $er life, that such a woman, the ‘perfect woman’ appears.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Do you feel safe with me, Mali? Do you trust me?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded. Cat’s eyes were tearing up.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It felt so good to be asked. Even more so by Cat. In this apartment-cocoon of hers. A place away from all places, of people, interferences, $he could feel it. It was like there was the possibility of that something could be decided here between their open and willing selves and they would never would have to leave.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali returned Cat’s magneto-dominant gaze with the opposite polarity. For the first time in $er life, outside of $er own imagination.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Let’s go sit in the living room, okay?” Cat got up and held out her hand for Mali’s and led $er back to the living room.&nbsp;
