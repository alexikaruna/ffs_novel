“This is so amazing!” was all Mali could say, as $he reached Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This is so amazing._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Just words. Regular words.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The last words I spoke to Koona._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Is life fucking with me?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Want a grape?” Cat offered with a playful arm out, erasing the melancholic thought. Cat had a more liberated and seductive look than Mali had ever seen to date. Mali accepted the grape and as $he bit down and found another heaven in the sweetness and slight sour bite of the blue grape. Delicious. Here $he saw what seemed like a younger, carefree Cat. Someone in her own element. Not that she was so heavy now, but otherwise was cultured and polished, to a T. This other girl was just — without so much. Natural. Just like the friend $he had been secretly in love with so many years before. That kind of ghost in $er that seemed could hide even for years but would never leave.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There were a set of wicker reclined ‘sun’ chairs with thick white cushions, on one of which Cat had taken out a luxurious sprawl, along with her bunch of grapes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sit here and we eat grapes!”, the younger Cat motioned to the matching lounge chair next to her. Mali settled down on it and stared out. Comfortable. Relaxing. With Cat. And this place, this view. A sense of being cared for and protected, something $he hadn’t in years except for fleeting moments.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Since $he began ‘going to hell’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he closed $er eyes and took a deep breath. The whole scene was still so Mediterranean-like. Too, it reminded $er of the peninsula on the west side of the Bay Area where $he’d grown up. So many associations overlapped in the synesthesia of comfort. Albeit half the world away, everything in this moment felt so comfortable and familiar, to a T.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This feels amazing.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Maybe this meant there was something wrong with the path $he was on? But $he didn’t have time to contemplate and the worry vanished when a few seconds later Cat held another grape to $er lips. Which $er snout accepted, biting down with a grin.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“These are so delicious!” Mali intoned allowing $er voice to rise and quiver just as many women would in receiving the same delicacy. $er voice still had a lot of work to be done but it had its moments of femininity when $he would actually let go, which were rays of hope and of encouragement to keep going. In fact the first day $he tried vocal training practice, $he found $er female voice - not a put on pretend voice, but something real. That actually felt less constricted and tense than what $he was used to as a man.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So it seemed that whatever kept $er from that voice and that person, was more in $er head than a real limitation.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Soooooooo”, let out Cat, marking each word slowly, “As I was saying earlier. What are you all about? I just cant figure you out still,” then she spat out a piece of honesty which left Mali on the floor, now the one cornered, “I mean, at moments I feel like you are someone who is like a man who wants to get to know me and ask me for dates and all that stuff. Its not like you’ve done it as much as I feel you might want that.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali could feel $erself bristle a bit inside. $he for some reason could not stand being seen by a woman like that. In fact, $he always had disliked it. It felt inherently predatory and wrong. The wrong signal. But what the world expected from a man. Contrary, $he just wanted to be close and the girl, equal to $er, not to feel like $he had pretensions of getting into her pants or necessarily leading her anywhere. That was virtually never what it was about for $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But on the other hand, it was true. Mali clouded a bit, as $he realized that $er own confusion was probably causing Cat to have a confused feeling too about $er intentions. $he wanted more than friendship with Cat if that was possible.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But Cat continued, “Then turn around and you are this - who are you? - amazing pianist and sensitive person, like someone I can talk to when really in life there is no one anymore, who can ever get in here, where you are with me. And then like leading you up this path, you are my best friend - a girl-friend,” she intoned the world ‘girl-friend’ as if stating a fact, “Like any of my girl friends but just more of a soul sister. So what is it, you?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat did feel a halting moment, as the unresolved Koona swept again like a breeze through $er mind and heart.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You want a box, huh?”, Mali smiled. Two could play at honesty.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, I don't know. I just want to know who you are and what you want with me.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Who said I wanted something besides you?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It took Cat a minute to process the sentence as it could mean more than one thing. First causing her to doubt her English for a moment, and then put her into a kind of spacey place while her mind tried to unravel it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well who said I wanted something besides you either!”, she smirked reveling in her intelligence, again not lost on Mali.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So here we are then.” Mali smirked back.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I guess so.” Cat returned. Long pause as they both stared out and continued working on sharing the grapes which Cat had placed on the little table in between their chairs, and trying to make sense of what was ‘not going on’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“All I can say is it’s nice, whatever it is,” Cat drawled in a beautiful feminine sing-song.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As if on stage cue, there was the sound of gravel, shoes and what sounded like skipping which preceded the appearance of Kwanjai. She bounded up into the gazebo beaming her happy-mischievous smile, as Cat rolled her eyes. At that moment Mali further recognized the humanity in Cat and that she did not just come out of nowhere as a polished Thai-Japanese spokesmodel but had a real family and past. The drama of siblings.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As if to punctuate the thought, Cat remarked, “and heeeerrrrre,” she drew out the last word, “may I present my kaaatoeeeeeey sister!”, rolling her eyes again and then into a smile, the one with the squinted left eye, as if letting Mali in to an ongoing shared secret.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mom said keep eye on you two. Doesn’t know what going on. Not sure who or what Mali is.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali almost choked on a grape and a piece of it went up $er nose.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“They say katoey’s talk more than any genetic woman and that they hold nothing sacred. They are often so vulgar. Well, here is my family’s contribution to affirming the reality of katoey folklore,” stated Cat again as a fact.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And as if not to disappoint, Kwan continued, smiling at Mali, “So are you a Tom or a Dee? You dress kind of like a Tom. But you know what, I think you are really a Dee you just have not accepted it?!”, lisping the last few words.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled into a laugh at not only the directness of Kwan, only young Thai’s could be this way and get away with it since it was all said and done with such lightheartedness, but also her perceptiveness. Too because $he remembered the conversation and verdict of the two boys at the night market.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali knew $he was a Dee if $he was a ‘she’. Although it was easier transitionally to appear as a Tom. Stronger, a bit alpha. Keep people at a distance who would otherwise be able to get too close. But that was all unconscious. $he felt like $he could not dress and act like a Dee and not appear ridiculous… and $he did not want to look ridiculous. Just like man-breasts. Not going to happen. If anything, it was heartbreaking because of $er aesthetic tastes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If $he wanted it, $he had so much work to do, even if it was possible, and&nbsp; &nbsp; $he barely entertained the possibility. So $he tried to comfort $erself with the salve of ‘in between’ and also being just a little too adamant against the concept of ‘transitioning’ to female…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

‘I have no transition, I am who I am,’ stating to therapists and anyone who needed to be told, again and again. Such a decision historically felt like a relief, to $er inner-being of not having to do such heavy stuff like surgeries, hormones, painful long-term electrolysis. Not to mention the expense.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But for some reason $he never found peace. To a third-party observer $er appearance was to the male side if for nothing more than the fact that $he stayed on the fence and hadn’t surrendered. Doubted that $he really could, and feared trying. $he was so used to the gridlock in $er body and being that $he almost had no reference how much better it could be if $he just step on to the other side. If there was 'the other side' for $er. That was the problem. $he didn’t know if $he could.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Kwan’s words brought Mali back to present.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And what they don’t know either is what you and Cat have. Are you girl-friends or ‘girlfriends’?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

At which point Cat flushed to a full crimson. Mali having done all $he could to hold back, snorted and began laughing uncontrollably, tears flowing freely, even dislodging the remainder of the grape that was still stuck in $er nose. Cat’s disturbed composure was priceless. Paired with the perceptiveness of Kwan’s exposure of the elephant in the room that both Cat and Mali had been tap dancing around all afternoon, not to mention months.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali was having contractions and pushed off the recliner and onto the floor to lay out the tantrum. It felt so incredibly good, this. Thank god for Kwan. Well for the whole day for that matter. The ridiculousness of _everything_ - this day, well just being a friend of Cat’s was amazing enough, but the car, her family, the restaurant, the piano… And to top it off the fact that this little katoey was sent to knock some reality out of the two friends and get the answer that they themselves were avoiding.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Coming out of the fit, through $er tears $he turned $er head to the right and looked right up into Cats eyes, which Cat averted. But still Mali could see Cat was also having albeit light controlled convulsions of laughter herself. $he reached to tap Cat’s arm, who turned, making real eye contact now with Mali. Mali smiled. They held their eyes on each other and as if contagious, a smile sprouted on Cat’s face also building until she also burst into laughter, still sharing the gaze. Maybe Kwan could crash the party but the party would just continue on a different frequency.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, you two stupid and crazy! She wanted tell you that - she did not want know all those thing - I did. _She_ wanted tell you that we going soon to city,” then switching to the easier for her Thai, directing at Cat “Father has some business that came up, he wants you to join him as the company counsel can’t make it,” then back to English, “So chop-chop - Mali is that right how you say it? - hurry up!, lets go?!” She turned on her heels and sashayed out of the gazebo and down the path. The ‘chop-chop’ thing to Mali confirming the family relation and intelligence shared between her and Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali and Cat were left to face each other and finish the laugh, prolonged by Kwan’s final monologue and stage exit. The laughter broke through the tension and was probably just as well for now. Interestingly, both felt free to call an end to the beautiful foray to the gazebo and head back to wherever it was they were going back to.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Shall we?”, Mali pulling $erself off the floor offered a hand to Cat out from the comfort of the recliner.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I don't want to but, yeah, it’s just too comfortable here!” as she got up and brushed her dress, “It’s been quite a day, hasn't it? Well, more for you, you had to get up so early and take a bus!”.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If that was only it._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh, and I am sorry - I’m getting pulled away - to help my father with business. I’ll have to explain at some point”.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali stored away one more curiosity.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The walk back to the restaurant, to the waiting family and the car ride back was pleasant and uneventful. Aside from Kwan and her attention from the lookout of her left side seat with her equally alternating questioning looks and then mischievous smile. Once on Mali, then on Cat, then on Mali, then Cat and so on, apparently finding this more entertaining than the music she’d been listening to on the way. She had tried to insist on being in the middle but Cat would not have it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There are just some things that only a katoey can see in another. Something like gaydar. And it was basically never that she had found a hole in Cat’s polished surface that had any real potential for exploit, until now. That surface was in place since her earliest memory when Cat returned from Japan for the first time some years ago and they met for the first time. She truly was not mean hearted, but as every katoey had to go through, often in their own unique way, to become themselves, she saw beyond appearances and culture. She had already formulated ideas about her sister. But add Mali to the picture… and it was way beyond what she’d even imagined. She found this supremely amusing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But how it would actually play out was still beyond her wildest dreams.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And at this point beyond Cat and Mali’s too.
