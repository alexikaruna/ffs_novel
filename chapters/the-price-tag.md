“Hi Mark,” he whispered, rubbing the photo gently.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The words escaped full lips, gray-blue eyes meeting with his current reflection in the mirror ahead while the old self, Mark, stared back blankly from the voided passport in his hand.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A person I am no longer.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And today even less, by legal name._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Switching his eyes to the freshly minted passport, he smiled, seeing his new name in the black ink. He ignored the icky feeling resulting from the fact that his picture looked more like a gay queen than anything resembling female. One who in the past habitually made a point of paying attention to such subtle conflicts and detracting feelings, at some point the noise and drive in the foreground had gotten too loud to consider such things.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The chain of events over years that brought this moment came from somewhere deep inside. A part of him - seemingly very physical and in his body - that seemed to hold an override switch even over what he wanted most in life and in his heart. This driven part of him had its own momentum and agenda.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or more like a compulsion? Was it healthy?_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When ignored or displaced, it would sooner than later return full force and irresistibly. The start was always sexual.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To be taken.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The both forbidden and delicious feeling in his gut that only in recent years had he decided to be okay with. If for no other reason than he had no control over it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To surrender. To feel embraced and penetrated completely that the energy in his pelvis could run up his body and fully express itself… straightening his spine, opening his heart and neck along the way before it then connected him to all that was and is.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But from there it led elsewhere. It needed to be expressed and he could never conceive of not doing so.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In intimate connection.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And not as a man. It was just not acceptable to not be a woman in this expression, the mandate coming from the most visceral parts of his body. Mental gymnastics and therapy aside, he could never get there.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Getting smooth. Waxing. Always the first step.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Where it led after required every ounce of self-permission he could muster. And each time more than before. Not to mention the time, money and energy. And fighting the unspoken feeling and thought behind all this that told him this was a waste of life and resources.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Becoming high maintenance. At least relatively.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_All vanity.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This drive supplied the needed aggression and the leap to execute on things the world thought - or wanted to think - were out of character and even not natural, not to mention breaking his own heart in the process.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So here I am._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The sadness came the moment he saw the old passport.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The man who once was.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He could see this, feel it. Who seemed to have a certain possible future. Not that he wished him back. Even when he’d tried, time and again over the years to give him another shot…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even as he watched his world get smaller and smaller, from being higher maintenance to the stress of not conforming to the likes of society as a whole….

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The path always ends up back here. One way or the other…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To my worst nightmare._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The hope of some _normal resolution_ had been dashed on the same rock too many times for the damage not to be imprinted.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He put his hands on his knees to balance himself and took a deep breath to balance the lightheadedness that took over more and more lately. He felt his ever faithful heart beat heavily in his ears. The walk up the five flights of stairs had had the same effect as it had started to of late.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Tears came up to his eyes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like wounding an innocent animal…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_My heart. My body. The faithful and insistent life inside, nature itself. The collateral victim.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was this feeling, that came more often these days, that…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m in the process of destroying myself.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

His trajectory felt like a runaway train that not only could he not get off, but at the same time, one he chose to stay aboard.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Another wave of tears came and he didn’t hold them back this time.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m sorry I could not be you,” he looked at the photo in the old passport, “I’m sorry I couldn’t make you happy.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All of which simply increased the crescendo of tears.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe this is why people don’t like crying.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Crying had always felt good before. But this time it was different.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe this is how people feel at funerals._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He’d never understood that completely either.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Looking back into the mirror he knew he’d fought his whole life to stay in the light and away from this. Even as a child, San Francisco had felt to be a dark place. The gay place. Of ‘alternative lifestyles’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And now here he was in this tiny studio in the Tenderloin, in the heart of the deep San Francisco fog, something in any possible future he would have prohibited from his life… Living in the darkness.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_BDSD, S&M, TS/TV… gay… bisexual…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Words from the shocking adult newspaper he and his brother as adolescents had once found on an SF street on a family visit to the city. All indelibly etched along with the feelings and images a child creates when contemplating incomprehensible sexual acts, some involving pain. Hearing about men, bathhouses and an out of control disease that was killing them. Men who dress as women.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And that he was a man too. At least seen as one.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And that I always loved being penetrated._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Well… I look gay.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It fits right in now._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Alone. No real in-person friends. Not having had a date much less embraced with anyone for years now.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not living… in this world or that one…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And mine getting smaller and smaller.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The ghost of the woman who could have been the _one_ for him cried along inside. Who he’d longed for since early childhood. She was the only point of doing anything in life.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Still.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But I don’t even imagine her anymore, holding her when I fall asleep at night anymore._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because it all seemed further from any possibility. With each step on his path toward what he called the ‘fem’, powered by this inner force, it seemed females in the world took a step away from him.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Except to have a gay friend._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He nodded sadly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’ve become my worst fucking nightmare._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And I’m not even fucking gay. Jesus!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If there was a way to put out into the world every possible wrong signal about who he was and wanted most deeply inside, this was it. And the heartbreaking thing was, whatever this was deep inside…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I still want it.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I don’t make a reversal.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_When I try it never sticks._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This is my price.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The fem is more important than my heart.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe than even my life._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He shook his head and dropped to the floor. Against the wall of the dark closet, falling back through the hanging clothes, embracing his knees with his arms, surrendering to the deeper tears. The ones that take over sound and breathing, running through the body as if they own it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because today they do.&nbsp;
