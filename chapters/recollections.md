Leaning against the windowed wall of the quirofano, Terrasanto took a deep breath and watched his two protegees, Salvatorre and Rivera as they completed the stitching and de-prepped the nose and completed forehead. But his attention turned to Ana which brought an inner chuckle and smile. At that moment his phone rang - it was his wife - and as so, gave the signal to the team as he stepped out of the room.

Not unusual for her to call and check in especially on the days of major surgeries, he answered.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Hola” he vocalized with a tone of caring and familiarity that belied their relationship.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Como va?” - how are things going?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, we got through the worst of it. Complicated nose - the worst we’ve seen this year. Horrible! But the result, well, you’ll see.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know I will. It’s to keep you on your toes!” replied Castaña.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Terrasanto chucked, “compared to you I do the work of a nurses assistant!”, referring to the fact that Castaña was a top cardiologist in Uruguay and known in most of Latin America. Not that one would ever realize that in the down to earth and warm way she carried herself.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m not so sure about that! This is Ana, today, right?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah, can you believe we made it?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You said always she was different. I’m still not sure, the way you tested her, was it right?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I wanted to be sure. She was a different one. I could just sense it. You know, everyone evolves of course. But the person who first contacted me and the actual woman who walked into my office last week, casi no lo creo. I’ll never know for sure but I believe she grew like crazy in the interim. And I’d like to think I had a part in that.”

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And apparently if the reports from Claudia are accurate, she took a deep sigh of relief too when she met you in person, huh? That was a bad scene for awhile. She really did know she wanted you to be her surgeon. Hmmm. I mean, you didn’t even send a car for her at the airport! Hmph!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It was worth it. I lose some by testing them. But that’s not what its about. In all the striving for perfection and vanity in this world, who would I be if there wasn’t something special about the connection to and what I am doing for each person I operate on. I mean, look at who I have to compete with!” the smile pervading his voice as he referred to his wife, “no, I could not wake up with you in my arms and look you in the eyes.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Ah que galan!”, but Castaña’s heart still melted, “Think of me as an accomplice then. I wrote most of those emails to her, remember??” as she arched her tone to emphasize.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Pure artistry. You know how to read people. And this one, even more, and how you figured out her level of Spanish and pressed her buttons not even in her own language,” he was now laughing, “But seriously, I read a concern, an unsureness, trepidation even in her - well actually then it felt a bit more like a ‘him’, with all respect…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He was referring to the period where from the first consultation and subsequent delay before she made the booking, then for him to delay the final surgery date confirmation for a few months. Part by necessity as he was changing hospitals in the new year, which facilitated the process to make sure that Ana really wanted this, knowing the depth of what the complete rework of a male face to appearing as female - not only that, of an attractive female - meant in life. Sure, the general \*gender community and WPATH did not advise or require letters for facial surgery, only gender reassignment. But he had his own standards.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Ana and his team had gone back and forth, escalating at one point to a name-calling email orchestrated in Spanish by Castaña alledging that Ana was being “incredula y loca”, crazy and incredulous, and that she should “tener un actitud mas positiva”, a brilliant double-bind.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Which Castaña knew Ana would take as feeling completely misread, as Ana’s emails had simply been attempting to be warm, perhaps overly cautious but also anxious to know her surgery date. Ana had canceled and then with Terrasanto playing the good cop and making the emails appear to have been from his assistant without his direct knowledge, allowed them to mutually reconcile. A rollercoaster for Ana, and little did she know, one architected to perfection.

“Well, all in a days work, huh?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mi amor, what a life. What do we do? Is it right? We can only answer to ourselves and god.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, its time you get back to Ana, no? And let that blessing spill over. She deserves it, dios!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Si mi querida, bye!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Terrasanto hung up.
