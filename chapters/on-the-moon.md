Cat stood in front of the mirror, in the reflection behind a pile of clothes on her bed, all outfits she’d tried and discarded before finding the perfect one for tonight.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She smiled ironically, shaking her head.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Really Cat?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All they were doing was meeting some mutual friends for dinner. Big deal. Friends. She and Koona.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Friends. Just friends.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She had no conscious backtrace of how she had gotten to this poi_nt.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe it’s the Thai mental-erase.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She smiled. The mental erase idea had started to wear in to Cat’s psyche, as of course, being Thai until it had been pointed out, she’d not known the better. It always made her laugh too.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She’d seen Koona every evening this past week. Which she had rationalized as making up for lost time. But now, had crept into seeming like a pretense.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That’s what it should have been. Best friends reconciled. But the tone, the background felt different whether she wanted to admit it or not.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Finally pulling herself together, she threw on a light white cashmere sweater over her black silk bra, and unlike her, a pair of slender fitting jeans and some black sneakers.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck it.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Friends, Cat.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Friends._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Dressing to go out with friends._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The night was cooler than normal, only a mellow heat remaining to the day which had turned a bit windy and overcast, and strangely lacking the typical humidity.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sitting in the cab, looking out the window on the short ride, Cat couldn’t stop the thought as it hit her...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What if Koona finds someone? Or has someone._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What if she tells me today she has a girlfriend and is in love?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A feeling immediately cast a dark shadow, mirroring the actual clouds over the early evening. Koona had not spoken about having anyone in her life or not.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe she has someone and this…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat shook her head, because at the same time, how in the world could they risk this? Could their renewed friendship weather one or the other of them realizing it was a mistake.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The taxi arrived.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

White restaurant building, flanked with green plants. Definitely upscale.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Definitely _us.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Us.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Us!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck, Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Friends._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Ever since that first night visiting Koona’s flat. She remembered having nodded off, the last thought she reluctantly remembered was wanting to cling to Koona. And Koona asking her why she was so afraid. Although she felt like it was obvious after revealing to Koona the disaster in her youth. The next thing she knew, it was the morning and was sleeping alone on Koona’s couch, covered with a light sheet and embraced with a body length pillow that somehow Koona had snuck in there while she slept.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_“Who were you holding so close, Cat?_”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona had taunted her playfully the next morning. Which of course caused Cat’s face to flush in intense embarrassment, in the moment of the mental erase of the immediate thought of who she was actually embracing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The fact of that pillow was not lost on her as she worked on it, over the days, what Koona had been thinking when she said that. If she was not mocking her just a little.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because fuck if Koona too had not felt that - that closeness that wanted to be that evening. Cat had not even told her the whole story of how she came to call her, and some important details of the night with Mali. But they had just hung out and chatted, more lightly than anything the last few meetings. Like old times. Despite all that floated around in the ether, they really were best friends. Time and separation had not changed any of that, it seemed. Despite whatever else was floating around, at least that had been constant.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Best friends._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was like the melancholic day and weather simply was a mirror of the feeling in her. The kind of day that reminds you how alone you really are in life. And makes you feel the tears at bay for how much you long for company.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Enduring company._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Company like…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like this week.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Perfect company.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If she could fix it so neither of them would find someone, they could just stay like this. No problem. Happily. It did not have to be more necessarily, at least it seemed to Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But, if Koona met someone???_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now that was not a pleasant thought.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As their two other friends chortled over some recounted situation, Koona turned to Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So what, Cat?” she whispered quietly, catching her friend, again off in another world. This weird spaced-out distance seemed to be coming more often with her. She stared at her. Into her eyes. Cat couldn’t go further nor let go, so she met Koona there. Well, better put, the feeling was submitting to Koona like an open book.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No choice with those eyes._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was not like she could even say anything, they were in company of other friends… friends who knew…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Nothing of this.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What 'this'???_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat broke eye contact first and shook her head. How much she wanted to say something. But the moment the impulse would arise, the thought would come to interrupt it. Because, how much more damage would she cause if she was wrong. Even if she could say it right now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was weird to her. Like mixed feelings… but yet, something seemed so clear and unequivocal.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What my body is saying. My heart._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In that moment she wanted to just cry.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**_That’s what_** _, Koona.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Right Cat, just friends.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_You’re so full of shit._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because every night, without fail, arriving home after spending time together there was a void. It wasn’t like before. As friends. Because before, even if she did feel lonely at times, she knew Koona would always be there for her. The next day. The day after. And always. Even if she had someone in her life.&nbsp;Or Koona.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But not now.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It had crept in like thoughts, images driven by longings in her that almost seemed better kept at bay because of the problems they’d cause. The feeling of getting into bed, her _own_ body length pillow melting into her and embracing _her_ back.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Koona’s embrace.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Her.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat’s new, ‘whimsically’ purchased body-length pillow being an extension of Koona’s own, and then connecting to Koona herself. The feeling of closeness and warmth that was just seeping out of her heart and desire, as if from under the carpet.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She kept it at bay but she was not stupid enough to pretend it didn’t exist. Because it did.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Mental erase or none._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smirked to herself forgetting where she was, that she was the object of Koona’s immediate attention.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So I feel things. That are not conflicted… except…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But what if things fail? She wondered too, if she was uncomfortable being seen as a lesbian - in a Dee-Dee couple, rare in Thailand. But no, it was so unusual but contrary, in fact if anything she wanted to be seen with Koona, as Koona’s woman, even possessed by her, not unlike a Tom would be with a Dee, but in Koona’s case despite her newly externalized strength, was still a woman. Not only a woman, a striking woman. A woman who captivated her but still a woman. Feminine. Beautifully feminine. And she loved that. She wanted that too. Feminine and strong.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And to be the same back._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Wow. I’m coming apart at the seams._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It hit her that all she knew - and saw - about female romance was Tom and Dee’s. Two feminine women together, it wasn’t looked at so well. It was if Tom’s weren’t seen as women in Thailand, but like katoey men, transmen, male.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Who cares anymore,” Cat murmured, to Koona’s amusement at the long delay and apparent randomness.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fuck Cat” she whispered laughing, “you’re really on the moon tonight aren’t you?” a smile Cat that felt so seductive it hit hard and brought her present again.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m so screwed.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Is Koona taunting me?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Does she see it?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Is this how girl-friends communicate?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She did not honestly know anymore. She realized she might be very well losing her grip on reality.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat, in the pain of conflict and despair whispered scathingly, “So, tell me about your girlfriends?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She immediately regretted what she said and how disingenuous it was. And she felt sad. She was torturing her friend, who…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona raised her eyebrows to the ceiling as her own heart sunk. She had caught herself - albeit subconsciously, hoping again. How long had this been going on for?! Something she swore she would not do here with Cat. A mixed emotion of that sadness coupled with a bit of anger too.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Which unleashed what she actually whispered back…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, I’m here with you, aren’t I? Every night this week if I’m counting right. That tell you something?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Which she did not mean to sound anything like it came out, either, her anger betraying her true feelings. It was supposed to mean that she was sacrificing. It came out anything but that.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because it was the truth.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Quietly and secretly Cat’s heart smiled.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_At least… I’m not crazy._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It felt real. This was a real thing. A could-be thing. She was not imagining things or hoping for what she’d already turned away and could no longer have.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smiled her Thai ‘teasing’ smile, Koona returning her Thai ‘devious achievement’ smile.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A win.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A dance the Thai could play par excellence. Cat winked back at Koona as they both returned to the general conversation for the rest of the evening.
