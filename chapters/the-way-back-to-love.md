The other gang-monks were nowhere to be seen when Mali reached the parking area. For which $he was glad as $he was barely coherent as it was.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I have to get away._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Sit somewhere alone._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Process this._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The hot and heavy sun had heated $er moped seat to a simmer. $he winced at the searing of $er ass even while easing on slowly. Having donned sunglasses and a thick gray button-down shirt for sun cover, $he turned the ignition, revved, pulled back and finally made $er way across to the return lane.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The splendor of the flat Thai countryside, mountains in the distance lay on the left in the brilliance of the light. It was special, so special. The stores, markets, the greenery. The other mopeders on the road. So many cute little young Thai women, like munchkins, headphones on, smug as bugs in a rug on their mopeds, with their Hello Kitty helmets off to unknowable places. A reality juxtaposed by perhaps the most surreal conversation and meeting $he’d certainly ever had, that even now it did not seem real, just minutes after.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And… yes Mali… always watch for incoming traffic.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was not Thai driving culture to check before pulling blindly onto a road albeit into full speed traffic and it still terrified $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But shock and surreality aside, something felt so much lighter in $er now. So many days and times Thailand was hard to take. But in this moment $he instead just felt love and gratitude for this place that was handing $er $er ass on a platter. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was going to take some processing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus Christ was he blunt.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Of course Mali realized a lot could be the language barrier and the need for Face to get the message across with the few English words he knew. But something about the bluntness haunted $er. The confidence of it. As if it really was the truth about $er fucked up life.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the past $he would have fought such bluntness. But inside, deep inside, $he recognized truth shoved in $er face. Somewhere too $he recognized that in about two minutes this apparently poor deformed man who was probably a saint had broken something that $he had been after for years, even with all the 50-minute hours, new-age woo woo crap and so much searching.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How deep this goes only time will tell.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I need time…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he needed time. Before going back. Before chatting to K. Before doing anything.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Before going home…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Crossing the bridge into actual Chiang Rai proper, recognizing the need for food, $he pulled up to a place that looked like it served beef noodle soup. Beef meals were sometimes hard to come by, so $he knew better to not take up the offer when found. The restaurant was empty but open.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he walked in and found a table a nice distance from the fan oscillating at the front. $he ordered a bowl of beef noodle soup. Hopefully it did not have MSG but that was something still far out of $er ability to ask for. Even if $he could remember the word, attempts at prounouncing it had never succeeded in an understanding.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The bowl was set in front of $er. After a few slurps of delicious salty broth, a song came on the radio…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

> I've been living with a shadow overhead,  
> I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed,  
> I've been lonely for so long,  
> Trapped in the past,  
> I just can't seem to move on!  
> I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away,  
> Just in case I ever need 'em again someday,  
> I've been setting aside time,  
> To clear a little space in the corners of my mind... \*

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A lump formed deep in $er throat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What am I doing here in Thailand but this?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Stuck, alone… fighting for something and to find my way._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Buying time so that I might one day actually live and be happy._..

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

> All I wanna do is find a way back into love…  
> I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine,  
> I've been searching but I just don't see the signs,  
> I know that it's out there,  
> There's gotta be something for my soul somewhere!  
> I've been looking for someone to shed some light,  
> Not somebody just to get me through the night,  
> I could use some direction,  
> And I'm open to your suggestions. \*

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$er heart once again breaking open, but this time to something somewhere very deep inside.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In this moment $he knew it was over. $he was new.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was over. No more holding back or shame.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he broke into full tears, bleeding them into $er soup in $er bowed head. It was all too much.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This song, this place, the Face, what he said.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How I hate._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I hate and hate and hate.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I hate everyone around me. They’re all haters to me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Haters haters haters_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

No wonder $he felt so awkward half the time when $he received only kindness from another. Worse after imagining that they hated $er too. No wonder, all of this. Made everyone a hater, but no, of course $he did not hate. $erself nor anyone. It was just ‘them’ that mocked, judged, criticized, made $er feel awkward. Not okay. All these people. All this life. Ever since the bullying as a child. $he emptied out, tears flowing and adding additional salted broth to the bowl.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he looked up. The middle aged woman cook and waitress looked concerned. $he smiled through $er tears, a real smile not $er bullshit half smiles. That too would be a thing of the past, hiding. And so like Thais, especially when they got the message that one was okay and was kind-hearted, she smiled back. $he loved this place. Anywhere with like twelve words and different types of smiles had to be okay.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The probably first place in the world to at least tolerate and even love their transgender beings. A place where the person talking gets to state what gender they see themselves.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A place where at least if you’re made fun of, you’re made fun of for what you are and not what you’re not.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_They might laugh at you for being transgender.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But no one calls you a ‘man in a dress’ like in the fucked up western world._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It still pissed Mali off but…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I hate how I am too. I hate what and they they're lauging. So what is that?_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It just made more tears.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he knew better than to try stopping. This was ground zero. At least for today.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then like as the rain torrent finally stops, even abruptly, the sun breaking and contrasting to all the dark clouds still around, it was kind of over. Feeling so light than ever in so long. The woman came over ‘new soup?’ she smiled.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No, I eat this one, I am not running from these tears, time to eat my own dogfood.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“… uh I didn’t mean the soup…”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was sure the woman had no idea what $he was saying but, nor really did $he. Or did $he know how in the end all this would pan out.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just that this was big.&nbsp;_
