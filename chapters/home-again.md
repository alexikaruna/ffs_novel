On the cab ride back from the Chiang Rai airport, it started to rain. Pour. Cats and dogs was actually a better description. The airport was quiet at this night hour, and felt remote from the small city, and the city from Bangkok. Traveling in the taxi on the country road leading into town, the buildings and streets, evening, Friday night quiet. Felt like $he had been away for ages.&nbsp;

_Only a week. OMG._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Strangely, all this felt good. Familiar. Calm. Known. A refuge.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Home.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was the first time Chiang Rai earned that feeling in $er heart.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As they wound around a few dark corners, over the little bridge and around the last corner to Mali’s apartment building, the sky truly let loose, pouring. The stopped car only a few feet from the building entrance still left no chance of not being drenched.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus, only less time of it._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali cursed making the manic bag-grab and run to the overhang after paying the driver._&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All wet, $he pulled $er bag up the stairs to the second floor, to apartment 18, at the end of the hall.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With dimmed lights, $he entered, put down her bag and began a shower. Once clean, dried and clothed, it was time to settle back in. This was home. At least for now. As much home - really more - than anything had been in the last several years, since San Diego. A place of comfort. Not huge, but more than big enough, with a lot of floor space. Perfect for stretching and hooping when it was too hot or as now, wet outside.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So full of everything - emotion, energy, $he picked up her hoop and put on a headband to which $he attached $er little red colored iPod shuffle

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Switching on the music, $he blindfolded $erself and settled in to the sound and the movement, beginning the orbit of the hoop around $er hips. Home. This was home. $er body, this music, the pathway to what seemed like all the light of the universe, freedom, expression. Connection, to everything and not one way, a conversation…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Words came from inside $er heart…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Hi. I am you. I am part of you. I feel. I long to love. I love being free. This sound, this movement…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali reached one arm up at a time, lengthening $er torso and neck, longing for the sky.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Being this, and dancing, it makes me feel alive where nothing else does… or did._
