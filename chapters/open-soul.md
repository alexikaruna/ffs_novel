_How long does a dark night of the soul last? Can it last a lifetime? Cause this one’s dragging…_

Mali had held the rather dark contemplation on the ride to the mall alongside the rehashing of $er visit earlier this week.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But since arriving everything was just about perfection. $he had settled $erself at $er favorite table at Doi Chiang Cafe, an open cafe in the free space in the middle of the top level of the mall. It was a modern mall with lots of glass and white. Buffered light filtered through from the opaque glass on the ceiling high above.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The mall was bustling - it was the weekend and rather a miracle to get this table. At $er side was a plate of vegetables and rice $he picked up from the vegetarian stall a couple levels below, to Mali the best meal in the world for about $1.25. To the other side was $er green tea latte. Doi Chiang made the best ones, beating out Starbucks easily. The ‘cute as a button’ baristas were exceptionally kind and friendly here too, greeting Mali as a regular with warm smiles.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With $er Mac booted, opening Gmail in a Chrome tab, a spammy subject caught Mali’s attention.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Hey you… from the past._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali laughed at the fact that $he was still going to open it and mentally prepared…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m going to feel cheap, gullible and used in about a second.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But at least $he had called it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he read the opening line.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Wow, you’re hard to track down.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Good one, Mali thought, as $he knew $he was going to keep reading falling further for the trap…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This is K, remember me? San Diego. Data Incorporated. Who saved your ass over and over until you disappeared???&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That one._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

At that moment Mali realized this wasn’t spam at all but from the past that now seemed like another lifetime. $he kept reading, intrigued.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Look this is going to sound too weird and… believe me its weird for me that I am even being driven to write this.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I had this dream - no it was almost too vivid for a dream - two nights ago and its staying with me for whatever reason and that’s not normal for me. Like burning a hole in my pocket so to speak, so I need to hand this over to you and be done with it, hopefully --_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_In it I saw you as a child - you know how in dreams you just know who people are even if maybe they look different or you didn’t know them then??, maybe around 8 years old? You were standing with your arms open as if flying and arched toward the sky. I heard the words ‘open soul’.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That’s it._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Weird, huh? Does that make any sense to you? Does it help in some way?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I know…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I feel like a stalker, I mean how hard was it for me to find you? You changed from Mark to the nickname MK and then to Mali. How I found you, the only constant thread: you’re continued posting on blogs and message boards re elementary ROR!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Duh, dude, if you’re trying to change your identity :(&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Its a good thing you suck enough to need that OL chatty shit otherwise harder to find you LOL. I knew you too because of your way of writing, you’re style stayed consistent. You write like a novelist and not a programmer. Easy to spot. Good for you :)_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Your friend,_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_K_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali exhaled realizing $he’d been holding breath. Absorbing the punch in a way. But that was K’s way and sense of humor. Not that it didn’t mean gritting $er teeth. But having learned the hard way, $he knew it was a good thing when K taunted you because it meant she actually cared for and respected you.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It did not make sense to Mali nor could $he even imagine ever being able to be that way to someone else just for the possibility that they might take it the wrong way and feel hurt. $he smiled, but so was K. It had been years.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Right then the words entered $er mind like a cutting of clouds, _open soul…_ _maybe around eight years old… does that make any sense?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was weird. The timing. Why today?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The Chinese Tune, dark night of the soul. Now this.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Too serendipitous to ignore?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali did not make any connections though. $he thought of $erself eight years old.&nbsp; Seeing $erself as a boy with open arms, standing and receiving some sort of bliss? No. That wasn’t the quiet, timid, creative and sensitive child $he knew from then. Expressing or showing outward jubilation would have been simply uncomfortable and out of character then. Possibly dangerous. Ridicule and bullying wasn’t an uncommon occurrence back then for the boy. This was not a posture $erself as child self had ever entered, $he was pretty sure.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had not had a bad childhood by any means. But at age eight, open soul, well, $he was not living the dream, if K was seeing the past, it was not _this_ child’s past. Now, if $he was seeing a potential, that could be.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because $he knew $he was still fighting the battle to be that. Exactly that.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Open like that._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just like that.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he remembered $er last day in San Diego, walking away from $er last girlfriend, the stable well paid job and the apartment overlooking the ocean, surfing in the early mornings before work. Stability. What felt like safety. It felt like another life. And that last day before departure to a new life in NYC, $he stood arms open on the bluff overlooking the beach, a feeling that could only be described as _feminine._ Feeling the delicious and what seemed to be natural feminine arch of $er lower back, chest opening, neck releasing and lengthening, poised. Self-conscious but doing it anyway. As little bolts of electricity oscillated entering $er spine from the ether.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That’s what came to mind from K’s dream.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was more than a little intrigued. Not just open soul, but that K had clearly taken effort to find $er. K… the last person on earth who would be so woo-woo about a dream, if it were. K was part of that San Diego life. Like the past calling the future back to it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Hmmmm.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What did it mean?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All the listlessness of the past week returned en-force bringing with it that shit Chinese Tune song. What did this mean?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Another mixed signal.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A clue?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had to… to get space… time… perspective and it was not happening here. Chiang Rai and everything surrounding $er life now loomed claustrophobic. $he felt desperate.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Away.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was a good as a time as any to take care of business in Bangkok…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Get my visa fixed for the next few months…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And…_&nbsp;
