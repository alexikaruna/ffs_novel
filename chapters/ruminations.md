Cat called in sick for work. Something she virtually never did on impulse although had full prerogative as owner. But it was Saturday, they could manage without her. She felt so bound up she could hardly move. It had been one of those nights, of a kind she had not had for years, where instead of consciously relaxing and luxuriously getting into bed, instead, like a teenager without any pre-bedtime routine, leaving makeup on because nothing mattered, she crawled in and curled up in a ball. Willing sleep or simply to disappear from existence.

Now sitting on the couch mid-morning she caught a glance of herself in reflection on her phone. Not a pretty sight. But beyond that, foreign. “Who am I?” she asked, shaking her head. Because the woman she saw was not the polished person she’d created herself to be. She now saw a woman with an edge. A woman who makes mistakes. Hurts others. A woman who…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Feels something mad intense for her best friend.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If they were still friends.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat had been on the edge of reaching out to bring Koona close last night. But the way Koona put it, there was really nothing she could say or do that would change anything in that moment. And it hurt bad.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not the less because Koona was right.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And she did want to make this right. But that also meant coming straight with herself. So to speak, at least.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because - and she realized it - from the 'girlfriends' question the other night to toying with her last night, she was playing with Koona the way she had with Mali. At least that is how it appeared. With Mali as a feeling, leading to an exploration. But with no deep regard to the other as a statement of anything in her heart. Not because it was not there. But something that although she did not know why she would - she could rationalize and walk away from as an ‘experiment’. Making the actual thought conscious… it stung. She did this to Mali. Would she have done that to Koona? Without Koona’s tough love last night?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A ‘piece of shit’, those were Koona’s words. Cat started to cry. She’d never ever ever think so lowly of Koona. Nor Mali. Heck, anyone!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat had thought herself to be an open, honest and caring person. Who was this person she was now confronted with?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was only noon and she needed a nap, her head felt like it wanted to burst apart.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After a long nap, she decided to get out and take a walk, clear her head.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It had been raining most of the afternoon but had cleared. Bangkok was fresh, even with a slight coolness, something to cherish when it did happen. She had made her way to the path along the lake at the long park along the road near her condo.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If I’d only listened a year ago.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I hope it’s not too late._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A deliciously fresh late afternoon had resulted, and the skyscrapers loomed on the other side of the park accenting a now clear blue sky. Somehow the open space and clearness helped, it seemed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She kept coming back to the moment when she had gazed at Koona last night. She could not get out of her head that woman’s beauty. In all the mess, in that moment she was most clear. And just about to declare herself. Which made it so ironic.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was that moment when she came clear on everything. Because it was actually quite simple once she saw it. Life gets simpler when you stop avoiding and running. She laughed how maybe the messenger with the greatest gift was one in the same as her most feared outcome. She needed to see Mali. The sooner the better.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali was looking forward to packing $er belongings, and finally the moment had come.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And to getting the fuck out of dodge._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Thank god that was my last night here and I’m leaving.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he chuckled, _back into the costume of insecurity_, remembering $er reminiscence_._ Today these clothes, and the makeup and jewelry $he put on felt good. So much in comparison to the attempt at ‘guy mode’ the last few days. As so it always was, changing to more feminine clothes - even andro clothes that were _made for women -_ always felt better, like coming home.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Soon $he’d be in Bangkok. By bus and then boarding a plane back to Chiang Rai. Finally Chiang Rai didn’t feel like such a horrible place to be. In fact, for the first time felt it as $er true home.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had left $er computer out for last, now making the one last check of email, just because.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And of all goddamn ironic things…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A message from Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just fucking because it had to be._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

> _Mali, I try to find you but can’t. I wait for you on Skype, your phone does not answer. I really would like to talk to you. If not see you. Please let me know you’re okay?!_
> 
> _Cat_

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali felt distance now from her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was like putting these clothes back on, knowing this direction once again was confirmed right, inside $er. It allayed the neuroticism of recent and and the whole situation over Cat. As well, after this hellish weekend facing $erself, $he realized too that Cat was not out of her mind at all for saying no to $er. Who in the fuck shouldn’t say no to someone in the place $he was in life? $he could hardly handle $er own red flags, how could anyone else?!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So the answer was easy and $he sent it off.
