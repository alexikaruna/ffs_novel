After it was all said and done, Mali laid down on $er yoga mat in the darkness of the night. In a different world now, $he could breathe. Windows were closed as the rain continued to be relentless, cooling the air to something that brought Mali to verge of the long lost sensation of feeling cold, for once relishing the warm air still trapped inside.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Inhaling deeply, at the point of exhale a smile coming to $er lips, as $he shook $er head. It was just all too unbelievable. $er brain was beyond scrambled. Bankok then the escape to Hua Hin and then back to seeing Cat this evening.&nbsp;Then back home to Chiang Rai.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat’s a fucking lesbian.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus christ._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Saying it out loud to $erself. Shaking $er head again. Smiling. It made $er laugh, the crazy irony of it all.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And $he was into me.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Well enough for that night.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Fuck.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_She found herself because of being with me._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I was the trojan horse so to speak._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Some fucking trojan._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali cracked up laughing at the double meaning and $er hate-hate relationship with condoms combined with the mediocre practical use of $er male anatomy over the years.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And then it dawned further…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_if I’d had my shit together by now…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I could have been in Koona’s place right now…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Before this… such a relationship… involved $er being a man.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And this thing that felt so feminine inside, longing to be taken, penetrated, to embrace Cat… on the surface was so tense, a protective mechanism preventing entry to the package. So often regardless of what was really inside $he felt so unfeminine, and the world… seemed to agree with this state, reinforce it and make it worse.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And unfortunately I seem to live my life at the whim of the outside.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The inner feminine was always there, always driving $er but always eclipsed by the world and the resulting lockdown of $er person.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But now it hurt more because it was maddening.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck me for betraying myself and not delving in deeper._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck the fucking world._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So $he contemplated. Why didn’t $he, hadn’t accepted who $he was? $he felt like $he’d been doing things in that direction for years. Always going further and trying something new. But always like the timid child sitting at the edge of a pool, swishing $er feet, waiting for it not to feel cold anymore.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And it always still felt cold._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But jump in?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because $he was afraid, the world was always against $er and $he didn’t believe.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The fucking problem is that the goddam pool always has felt cold._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So now what?_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had felt so lost after Hua Hin.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But strangely in this moment, $he felt a bit better and more coherent now from knowing how Cat had _seen $er_. That was itself a gift.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It's all about how others fucking see me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just because Cat saw me for good then I’m okay._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Tomorrow when someone ridicules me I won’t be.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was all about others.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How do I see myself???_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Really see myself?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What do_ **_I_** _really want???!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because now, she was freed from the ‘perfect woman’, Cat was now out of the picture. And strangely $he did not feel sad about that, in fact relieved. They could still be friends if $he wanted - potentially, eventually maybe. It was one of the amazing aspects of $er personality to flip to platonic, often in just a moment.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The ‘perfect woman’ experience that should have ‘cured’ $er turned into the biggest possible disaster with a clear answer to the failure of $her hypothesis.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Despite all the turmoil, $er heart was open now. And the connection with Cat lingered but $he knew $he needed someone else now to connect with.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Someone unbiased._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Someone who can see beyond these conflicts in me.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Someone who will call me on my shit._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Also hopefully someone who understands attachment theory and perhaps as one last bastion would either cure $er of the repressed shit that went down in childhood that has caused all this.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The lat ten years of my life. The wasted time, energy, implosion of work relationships and a potentially stable career, the economic cost. The reversals…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not to mention the social cost, the void I live in.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As for social Cat had been pretty much it - for this year certainly and also making up in spades for the void of the past few as well.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was time to get help. Enough of psychologists. $he had been there and done that and they had failed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I need a real friend. A smart friend. Someone who won’t lie to me.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But what friend? No one came to mind.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he laid there, spacing out, breathing, reliving, processing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Somehow $er mind wandered as tiredness overcame $er to a flash feeling of how it felt walking in the sunset warmth sun in San Diego.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Open-soul.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The email._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Oh shi_t_!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali felt the flowing heat that only comes from a major screw-up.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She’d never responded.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was like in $er mind $he had because $he had written, but just not sent it because $he couldn’t complete the thought yet. Well, and $he’d gotten distracted by the trip to Bangkok… and then the Hua Hin mess.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$er heart and stomach sunk. That heat of the screw-up in reconnecting with K felt like a fever running over $er, combination of fear, anxiety and excitement.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Jeopardy of missing out.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Having offended a friend. Not just a friend, or anyone… K!&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he pulled up the terminal application on $er mac and logged into K’s IRC channel.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The consoles green text against black was ever sexy and in the day’s of K in San Diego, logging on to her chat server felt like magic, a break from the constipated Microsoft world with GUIs and shit that had the tendency to get fucked up since the user never really knew what was going on under the hood.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was actually nowhere near sure that this would work. It had been years since logging on to the IRC.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But if it still is… it will be faster than an email. Cause she's always there._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although Mali often had trouble remembering names, phone, street numbers and IP addresses for some reason could stick for years and years. They had a certain feel or flavor to them.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali: _Hey K. Its Open Soul…_
