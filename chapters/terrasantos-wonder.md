The pieces - spear-like pieces of a few inches, really, not slivers - of white bone, tarnished with areas of blood and membranes sat atop the metal cabinet on a laid out white surgical choth.&nbsp;

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They caught Terrasanto’s eye for whatever reason as he stood once again breaking to let his team complete the suturing of the insides of Ana’s mouth. Closing the incisions used to access and remove what was previously a rather masculine jawline and squared chin compared to most feminine facial bone structures.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I could never do this. I don’t have the strength.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just the physical recovery alone!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Ana would face at least two months of intense recovery from this operation. Add on the trauma from whatever she did for sexual reassignment, if any, the hair transplants, electrolysis. Her overcoming of anorexia in exchange for her deserved dose of hormones, as her Mexican endocrinologist had made clear, perhaps saving her life. Inserting a needle into her own body on a weekly basis to bathe her insides in the feminine substance. He could not imagine an Ana weighing less than now and making it through this surgery.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I couldn’t have operated on her weighing less. Too risky._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As he stared, at what some might consider carnage while others, hope, he couldn’t help himself to not marvel again at what it must be that would drive a person to do this.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

No, not just the surgery - this surgery, the cost, the recovery - but all of it. Ana had mentioned her case and it remained stuck in his mind, even heart. Not necessarily an effeminate man compared to many, not even a gay man. But perhaps, as she worded it, with a feminine energy that was not lost on others, detractors and romantic interests alike. Women who wanted a man who… for little did they know, was female, or feminine at least. Perhaps glossing over their own hidden attractions to the same sex.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But the interim. As she had described, several years of not appearing either as male or female, as she summed up the experience in the words ‘cara de hombre, cuerpo de mujer’ ('face of a man, body of a woman') that had been used so regularly by others in passing, in form of words, stares, ridicule to their friends. Ana then who had yet to realize the softness that her being exuded wasn’t just physical - or didn’t want to be.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Her ‘cara de hombre’ wasn’t a horribly masculine face but was definitely male. Add to that the conditioning, surely anxiety, fear, from which came defensiveness and a way of holding herself in the world that caged her true expression, albeit feeling like protection. And as she related to him, a cage she constantly fought and finally had progressed to a point toward its frontiers. Perhaps the psycho-spiritual shift that would happen as a result of this surgery would be equally or more important as the physical result itself.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not just physical._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It amazed him. Yes, this surgery was seemingly all physical.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Ana had described her reticence: vanity.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even the whole transition: vanity.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The time in front of the mirror or in the salon that could be spent otherwise serving the world. So many reasons not to do it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What had started with clothes and makeup, any easy thing that could be done. All seemingly harder to do than the default of not doing any of it and being a ‘man’, harder to live by, more time, higher maintenance, yet the more she did it the more it would not go away, the more it was right. And the more the time past, the less she found herself returning to masculine presentation for safety. Instead of buying women’s clothes, makeup and then in periods of despair throwing them out to return to the hope of being a man, more for the reason of who she longed for in her heart than for a solid social identity in the present, the male clothes bit by bit dropped from her wardrobe into the thrift shop donation boxes. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then as she related the critical mass. A moment realizing that despite still being addressed as a male in the world, if she wanted to go back to being a ‘guy’, it would take a year or two - just physically to return there, but that there was no congruent way she ever could.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Which anyway was the last bastion, because then came her first hair transplant, the accompanying medication to keep from losing more hair from the adversarial testosterone her body was creating. And the rest was history until now.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And then at some point between when she had first contacted him and now, there was a whole, integrated woman. Cara de hombre or not, he chuckled, Ana was here to stay and had made that clear in her emails and how she had showed up in Uruguay. Surgery or not. And that was what he wanted to hear and pushed her to communicate in some way that convinced him. He thought of his wife. He thought of what it really meant to ‘serve the world’ and if Ana had any idea who she touched - and was going to - by following her heart.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She was not the first and surely far from the last of such a person he would see.&nbsp;
