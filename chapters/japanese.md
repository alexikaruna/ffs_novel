As Koona went to the kitchen and was filling the glass Cat felt a shadow. Something eerie. This place felt almost Japanese. Substitute the bed with a futon and you had…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cat?” Koona returned with her hand out offering Cat a full glass of water, “Cat ka?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona furrowed her brows, “Cat are you okay?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was immobile, staring directly ahead, what would be out the window if the shade were open. Koona set the water down on the coffee table and softly put her hand on Cats as she kneeled. Cats’ body literally jumped tense and then softened as she woke from wherever it was.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona saw fear and tears in her eyes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat stared at her as if she did not know her. Or was afraid. It was as if her two worst nightmares, the things she’d simply not faced in life in a moment were coalesced by Koona.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cat, it’s okay,” Koona stayed with her, removing her offending hand and keeping eye contact. She’d never seen her friend like this.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Its okay, please, talk to me, whatever it is, it’s okay.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat’s eyes softened a bit as she looked at Koona and took an audible breath. A tear fell, “Koona…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It’s okay, do you want to hold my hand?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat reached with both hands and pulled Koona’s to her as she searched her eyes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Still with fear but ready to talk, Cat spoke, “Koona, I’m so afraid,” her hands responding with a tremor as if by command, as Koona held back gently but firmly. Cat knew what the things were. But the shaking in her body, _that_ was the scary part. She couldn’t understand it. Nor control it, like a visceral anxiety reaction.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What happened just now? Where were you? What were you thinking of?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I was looking at your place. It reminded me of Japan,” she paused as if wondering if to say what was next, “It was a place… not unlike this…” Cat trailed, “it’s so weird…”
