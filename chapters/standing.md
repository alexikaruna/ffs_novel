Several Months Later…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Chatuchak Park, Bangkok**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A slender silhouette stands by the edge of the lake amidst a chorus of cicadas. A thin oval head, slender body and big hair make an appearance that seems as likely in a Dr. Seuss book as in the surreality of predawn Bangkok.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Alone.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Stationed under the tree with huge protruding roots, half in the water and half on land. Those which are visible and those only known to existence by inference or from their subtle reflection through the water. And the massive trunk they hold upright. Above, the branches extend like protective arms in many directions with the effortless grace that only a tree can embody perfectly.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The figures arms, like branches too, are held circularly in front of their chest, fingertips of each hand pointing to the other, knees slightly bent, back straight. All seems to be in complete stillness.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It’s way before sunrise but nevertheless tank top weather, the sultry humidity foreshadowing yet another completely normal Bangkok day. The sweet smell of natural bug repellent lingers around the figure. The early morning exercisers - joggers, the tai-chi and qi gong crowds one by one and few by few are making their way, to their usual spots and routines. Usually the first ones here, some notice the return of the silent farang to the scenery. Several months had passed since they’d seen…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Him? Her? Too slender for a man. Too minor a head. Too tall for a woman. Wider hips than a man. Not a woman’s chest. Crazy mop of hair, frizz that seems on its way to wanting to belong in some horrible frustrated neverland.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The face hidden in the shadows hides its distinctions secretly in the one time of day the conflicts are fewer. The occasional passing and curious onlooker wouldn’t know at this hour that the situation was almost as ambiguous inside as out.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Whoever.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Falang never show face._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali has long loved the solitude of the early morning. Time away. Alone. In the darkness. Before the emerging forms and definitions could be easily cast. A relief. Time to reset. A chance at a new beginning. Toward this everlasting hope and passionate drive inside.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For whatever reason years ago $he honed in on $er body being the answer to the conflicts $he felt. All the tension $he seemed to have no conscious ability to release or control. Not to mention the romantic sense and sexuality which has defied $er apparent male incarnation. The abundant feminine energy in $er pelvis $er primary teacher.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But even in the brightness of day, like the tree, half in, half out, half in overwhelming feeling, half immobile, half rooted in the ground yet stuck, but with a head and heart - and hope higher in the sky as seemingly anyone, as such was $er existence.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A tall skyscraper looms through the trees, on the other side of the street, poised to provide shade as the sun rises. ‘TMB’ in red and blue letters glows at top. Mali has positioned $erself specifically in its line of shadow knowing that $he will be standing here immobile for $er usual forty-five minutes - and it being important to be shielded even from the earliest morning sun. As much as for a few extra minutes of shaded solitude as to protect $er skin from what will already be indelible sun rays, and its resulting entropy.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not good for skin or beauty._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A few ducks float by on their early morning food paddle making an ever so slight murmur in the still water, oblivious of the silent presence.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali is after something. Been after something. For years now, day after day, going inside. Not to mention all the years leading up to such. This practice, alone, the solitude and discipline for the good yet still not masterful rewards, also matched the rest of $er life.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Good but not great.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Closer but not spot on.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even with this essential morning reset, on the average day things virtually always went downhill from the stillness, poise and whatever grace achieved.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I only know a few things for sure. I may not know exactly where home is. But I know this is the way._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali had the somatic inner confidence to dismiss every teacher, sifu and martial arts master to date.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_My power is softness. Slow, minute movement. When my body becomes more aligned, more symmetric, muscles balance themselves, it brings…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Joy._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Anything or anyone empirically contradicting this got the boot. Anyone who espoused speed or force before perfect slow mastery.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he knew this joy was inside $er but no one seemed to see it. It had at best been drummed out of the public view with laughter and ridicule in childhood. If in fact it was ever fully accessible at all in $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I can’t remember… But I can feel it there. The thing under everything. Like the eternal flame. Perhaps at times a tiny flicker but it’s always there. Another of the few things I actually know._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Only in the past year had $er discipline crystallized to a level of conscious comprehension, a system and checklist with consistent results.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_As the body becomes increasingly symmetric, front to back and side to side, and the muscle tone between opposing muscles balance…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was the practical theory $he’d come up with to describe how $he could get there. And more and more $he could apply it at will.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_…comes true authenticity, joy… super-consciousness…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Or in more practical words, the ability to…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

J_ust be myself._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This translated practically to acquiring the ability to move and adjust consciously in micro-movements, aligning the front-back tilt of each body region as well as the lateral and twisting relationship of every body part to the other.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was ironic that the discipline $he poured in to excavating $erself - which showed increasingly as female or yearning to be such - in its diligence felt disciplined, focused, even controlling…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smirked.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Using the male programming to become free of itself.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Pretty funny.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It made $er happy - and confident - to know that $he never had to be lost to $erself again. At least for long. What in the early days required much more effort, time and muscle - and sometimes loosing the path for months on end - as much as now it required the opposite - softness, balance and alignment, finesse. And just a few moments.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The practice was $er rock. For the mornings. Along with almost daily afternoon hoopdancing. Practice probably being the wrong word. Joy would be a better one. It was a desire and release, not a ‘have to’. Standing, solitary and contained. Hoopdance, passionate and expressive albeit following the same evolution over the years of brute force and effort moving toward grace, softness and minimal effort just as standing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A slight breeze caresseed $er bare arm and face from the side. Like a gentle tug. A reminder of what is truly delicious. At the edge of the lake, like at the edge of life looking on in…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_My life… practicing… just to be able to exist…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Each day coming and going like a number, starting like this.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was $er lifeline and consumed much time, including what would be otherwise social time. $he was always aware of this tradeoff of friends, fun, even maybe lovers.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’d have it no other way in the early morning. This moment I only want to be here. Alone.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The dusk, evening, going to bed alone, was when the longing would present.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A third thing I truly know.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smirked.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Today we’re counting I guess…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Ever since $he could remember, the embrace, with a girl, now a woman. The always elusive melting contact together. True connection, intimacy.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The primary dream.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And the heartbreak that the same force $he was connected to now leading $er into increased authenticity was in direct opposition to ever having this.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That one magical night with Cat aside.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even the general limerick in Thailand had been getting drummed into $er head…‘Thai ladyboy like men not women’… $he’d heard it over and over and it made $er pissed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

&nbsp;But what else could $he do? To stop fighting was not an option. To stop this practice, the entropy of $er grace and structure would begin to unacceptably degenerate in just a day or two making $er run back to the early morning discipline. Stopping this fight would be also akin to stop loving and revering life… and what $he felt inside.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The same reverence made $er doubt some of the things $he was doing now in $er life, and wanted to do. But they were all connected… $er pelvis, standing straight, opening $er chest and heart, feeling female, hormones, surgeries…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Too much passion._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I’ve come a long way. And every step of it toward the fem.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That night_ kind of proved it’s working.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In younger years $he felt due to the excessive tension and gridlock in $er body that trying to express the passion inside was like sending a million volts of electricity through a thin constricted wire. Energy that when tried to be felt and expressed would result in even more gridlock and tension because there was just too much of it and a constricted conduit getting blown out, burned.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But that night…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The full charge of energy came through $er unimpeded.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_For the first time ever… and with another person…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he shook $er head in disbelief still of that evening and smiled. It had been ridiculous. Everything $he had dreamed about in connection with another.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Complete union.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But the moment after…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Complete separation._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Until tonight.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Hopefully.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And why I am back here in Bangkok today._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali slowly and slightly rolled the bottoms of $er feet. Pressing the ball of the left foot just behind the big toe into the ground. And then the same on the left. Then each heel too, alternating feet. Outside ball of left foot. Then the right. Inner left ankle. Right ankle, slightly flexing each joint. Outer ankle. Pushing the left heel into the ground and feeling the left knee extend. Then right. Left hip up toward ribs. Right.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Left shoulder up… down… forward… backward, all with the right side in turn. And so $he worked through the body the preliminary exercise which allows the generally contralateral and differentially left and right wired brain sensory-motor areas to create a more accurate map of the current and actual body asymmetries and muscle tone imbalances.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The magic of all this which Mali discovered is that by bringing such awareness to the brain, without further conscious intervention, the brain takes over to do an often almost miraculous realignment… Essentially creating a ‘current state’ map, to which the brain is able to superimpose with the more ideal prototype it already knows.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_My true self._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The template of the best me._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The image of a perfect, open spine with arms outstretched, unimpeded to the heavens came to $er as a visceral feeling. The innate, wise part of $er that seemed would take over and run the show if $he could eventually let it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Being all that I am… and can be._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Just as a prism divides the pure light into a rainbow, the longing for bonding, intimacy and love had somehow become disconnected from $er innate sexuality not to mention, male or female identity.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was somehow now in this in-between place, living in fragmented light. It was currently a painful mystery that in the moment the prototype $he was after seemed to be at odds with $er core dream and longing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Standing was $er way of getting the cohesive light back, it’s what $he felt and trusted… And Mali was spending $er free time writing an app which formalized this system…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe other’s bodies work similarly…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So things - all this that is my solitary life - could mean something, someday, to someone else._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Another warm breeze caressed $er now slightly perspiring skin, the resulting coolness like a whisper making $er feel that everything was and would forever be alright. Everything was already okay in the pure now. Nature and the outdoors had that way with $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$er eyes teared as the peace of stillness overcame, finding that familiar better place. Muscle tension ceased to exist and as the alignment progressed, $he came to be as one.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Moments ceased to be divided and flowed together into a timeless place. A place where forty-five minutes, an hour, would pass like nothing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he fell into the nothingness of stillness and balance.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The sideline of life where $he felt $he lived most waking moments disolved.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_There is no sideline.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I just am.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And have always been.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This. &nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A deep breath filled $er like water in the desert breaking the tears of freedom open further. The insidious complex of tension in $er neck, shoulders and heart broke as it often did.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A full smile came over $er face as the tears silently streamed rivers unhindered down $er cheeks, cascading down $er neck and down the middle of $er chest. $he could not explain the feeling aside from being authentic joy. Relief.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And the tears, freedom.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was nothing more addictive than feeling this way.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Nothing._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Why I do this.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And everything._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was the only actual feeling in life that made $er know not to fear death. The mind being off and everything being still was actually very sweet.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Now I remember…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Who I am.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m nothing.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And everything.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Onwards of an hour later $er closed eyes dozed open slightly allowing in with always surprising vividness color and light as if $he’d slept, as if it was a second new day but in a Technicolor world. Across the striking dark blue lake $er eyes made out the form of a slender and athletic Thai woman jogging. Poised and straight, a graceful neck that seemed to oscillate with each foot-fall, the envy of envies to Mali, being the major challenge in $er own posture. Straight black hair pulled back in a French braid. The muscle tone in her jaw depicted determination and strength, in a kind of masculine way that $he loved to see in a woman.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Strong, beautiful. Hot.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What she takes for granted._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then came the immediate sadness.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What I do too._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What we all do.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Breath entered again making its sweet presence know in Mali’s lungs.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Under it all the familiar feeling of both wanting to be with and wanting to be at the same time.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I hope this is what’s coming back to me tonight.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The almost gone feeling of hope was still an ember. But $he checked the thought as the first vestige of tension and disharmony returned to $er body. As $he had become used to in life, letting go of what $he hoped for and creating a more compelling plan in place of the originally desired tended to work magic.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not Cat then.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Instead, me!_
