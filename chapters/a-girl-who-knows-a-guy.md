**KO:** I know a girl who knows a guy who knows someone you need to see there…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

K’s letters forming words as they streamed in bright green onto the black screen, hijacking away from Mali the terminal $he was coding in.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How did she do that???!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Hello to you too&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was not going to admit $he had no idea how K had done that. K was on another level $he knew $he’d never reach.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** On Phahonyotin Road - you know that? On the way to the White Temple. Before the turn. Theres a market.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** WTF???!!!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Just humor me, okay?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Now, you’re going to drive and park at that market which is on the left side of the road, and to the right of the market theres often a group of monks standing around there. You might have to go back a few times. But look for the one with the face. Ask to speak to him.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali hated it when guys would direct $er ‘now your going to…’ in unsolicited advice, but from K it was like kinda sweet.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** The one with 'the face'? Uh…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** The guy says you will not mistake him. Whatever he means by that… is for you to live, thankfully for me.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** And, uh, why? I feel like monks want nothing to do with me how I am. I feel weird. Does he speak English?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Well then go and do your thing and feel awkward and stumble around in your kinder-Thai, I am sure that will endear him. Don’t have much confidence in yourself these days, do you?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali would have to work on that one later. Was not the first time to hear that but $he was starting to get it more.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** So really, who is this girl who knows a guy who knows ‘the face’?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** You think I am just that kind of geek? &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Heck, you are still freakin wondering how I just took over your terminal.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Uh…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** That was not a question. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** So will you go?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**Mali:** Anything for you sweetheart.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Good. Write back when mission accomplished.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** And stop calling me ‘sweetheart’, what will GF think if she sees?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Fighting for my life here.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** Bye.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

‘SESSION TERMINATED BY HOST’ flashed on the screen.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali contemplated for a second the fact that although knowing K was gay and the few other things $he knew about $er, $he didn’t know a lot about her life and felt a growing curiosity now that their friendship had renewed in a new ‘non-professional’ context.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt the impulse, as was with strong people in $er life, to want to make K proud and go on the mission, after which first agenda was to find another crack in that wall of hers and find out what was going on in K’s life.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he’d never known K beyond this level of mysteriousness. But here K was, seemingly trying to help $er in earnest, even sending $er to do ‘weird stuff’ for $er own wellbeing.
