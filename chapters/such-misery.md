“Owwwww!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The pinch in the relived memory had barely hurt, but reality was worse. Mali released a strong flick of $er middle finger at the subject as $he felt the bee-sting dig into $er forearm.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mumbling to $erself, “Shit, I’m really out there, huh?” As $he took action to get the stinger out and away.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Here $he was again.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Back in 'reality'._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Besides the sting on $er arm, $er ass hurt too from sitting so long.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What the fuck am I doing here?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Stuck in the depth of it. This fourth day at the deserted resort $he was not incredibly different or further along solving the same problems $he’d arrived with.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The sperm-fish kept up their vibrant life in the happy brook below as $he had deliberated and fixated.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And come up empty._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Reliving the past had medicated $er emotions and that’s all. It had provided no more information to help or clues than $he already had.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like watching the same goddam movie over and over.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As with such, $he felt a kind of hangover from it - like riding a roller coaster in your mind that you can never ride again in reality. It had that kind of sting in it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Clinging to something you can’t have.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Ever have.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like having the urgent impulse to have done things differently. The moment you’re dying.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or maybe the realization that you actually want to keep living... the moment after you jump._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Most of $er life Mali lived in an emotionally and romantically creative heart and head, in a world that provided almost no fulfillment to $er creations. Ever since very young, imagining a girl with $er. Whenever $he was down or felt the coldness between $er parents, or whatever despair from the outside, this is where $he’d gone. Always believed, always hoped.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_At some point do you start giving it up because it’s not happening?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Uh…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It had happened._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And it's passed._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt in her bones the ache, knowing that no further thought or introspection could solve anything. Cat had disappeared. Cat for all practical purposes $he had to consider over.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And another thing was for sure: In past flirtations with the fem, $he could&nbsp; compartmentalize and put away the episodes. Because they were days, weekends, maybe a week or two.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But this had been two years.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Body changes. Feelings. $he could never ever again sit in front of a woman and with a straight face profess to be a man. Unless it was a man who wanted to be feminine and act and be as a female, sexually and in dress. And to $er, that was not acceptable either.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I won’t be a fucking man in a dress and seen that way. I’m not a crossdresser. Power to them…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali had met crossdressers over the years but never understood how they could return to being a guy and living in the world. Or wanting to. Some of them were gorgeous.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But $he still felt hope just for a simple, pure, down-to-earth relationship.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not a woman._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No one sees me as one._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m a joke…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She knew how people in the USA seemed to view ‘people like $er’, and in Thailand…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Constantly stared and often laughed at._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then Cat, who seemed to embrace $er and then dropped $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat wants a man. Well, at least a rockstar.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Would that be so bad?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali opened $er eyes again, which were already open but now back to reality and where $he was. Truly, $he had been sitting here for hours. Since the morning. It was now dusk and the sultry air with its soft warm breeze was filled with the tunes of cicadas and not much else. The surrounding turret huts were still dark and mostly abandoned aside for one in the far distance, the only sign of life.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If $he knew to go deeper, $he’d have felt betrayed. Cat, who could have anyone - man or woman - it felt like she led $er to the ledge though $he jumped on $er own accord...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Without fucking parachute._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And $he’d only made it so far, crashing and getting scratched through trees and branches…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_In the end deserted by the one who'd given $er the go ahead to jump._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And now I’m in a ditch in the middle of nowhere._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_May as well not even be alive._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A tear fell and a soft, calming sob let the river flow.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was not out of the woods but had to go on. $he was in a corner. $he needed help. $he could go no further doing what $he had already done, living how $he’d already lived.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Maybe it did mean just embracing ‘the middle’ in between genders more. There were a lot of things $he loved about $erself and $er life. $he was smart, $he loved to hoop-dance which fulfilled $er in many ways. People who know $er embraced $er, those whom $he let in. Albeit not any women, Cat aside, and well, now Cat too.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Theres no further I can bring myself. I'm at the end._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It’s time to get help._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even in four days in solitude here she had not resolved a thing beyond that was known:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- I am not going to be a man with breasts.
- If I continue hormones its irreversible and I’ll become sterile if I have not yet.&nbsp;
- I could get face surgery and maybe it would all get better.
- But will any woman have interest in me, even love me? Would I even pass as female? At all?
- Will hormones change me and I still want a woman? Because I couldn’t stand wanting a man.

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he could see the surgical masks, smell and feel the anesthesia running through $er veins, and what felt like the dark side loom. The Chinese Tune .

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A vision of a feminine looking poised man entered $er mind, sitting having dinner with a woman in Mexico. It could be. Maybe that was the answer. But the vision quickly evaporated emotionally when it came to sex and intimacy.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m too far gone…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali finally made $er way to the small outdoor restaurant that $he had made $er favorite while there. $he wore the same cut off jeans still and a button down shirt tied at the waist. As $he sat and looked over the late evening road and seaside, over time $he saw a few couples and families coming in. The last was two women together.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe they are a couple.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Looks nice.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was distantly envious and didn’t let $erself get too close to that story, as anyway $he could slice it, it was a world away from $er in possibility.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Regardless of being dressed completely androgynously, no makeup, $he felt a sense of belonging there, as something. That something which was kind of ever present with $er but seemed to crumble the moment $he came into contact with the world.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Tonight was no exception as $he looked over and caught stares from a couple of the tables further in. Nothing hurtful, just too much attention. It meant something was wrong with $er. Otherwise they would not be looking. It felt like everyone $he came into contact with was pointing out a fundamental flaw in $er. Either more directly or trying to hide that they saw it. $he felt the heat of futile anger rise inside.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It too was the pain point set in motion from $er decision that maybe $he could let go of all this fem stuff. As was always the case, when $he let things go, it became apparent that regardless of how bad things might be while being dressed and in makeup, the difference of going back to male mode, $he had simply forgotten how bad the full monty actually was.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And that was for now the only way $he could track $er internal progress with $er identity.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I don’t want to be seen as a guy and be invisible.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’d prefer this always._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After $he paid the check, $he took a walk in the dark along the road bordering the rock beach. At a point up ahead $he saw some cars being parked on the road, and a couple men who looked like parking attendants for the cars.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As $he passed one stood and stared at $er. Just stared. $he made eye contact. Mistake. He just stood and stared. $he could feel it as $he passed as the tension of anger and frustration built. And worse when $he heard the burst of laughter that followed between the man and his friend. $he’d become too used to it. It sent $er into gridlock in $er sensibilities - to react and lock $er body up or to let it go. Male conditioning does not encourage letting such things go.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A dog came out of nowhere and started barking at $er. Already on edge from the men $he angered further and grabbed a rock and fake-lunged at the dog. Which stopped it. But only until $he turned to go on $er way, as it started again.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he threw the rock hard at a sign and screamed, “fuck this fucking place… fuck these fucking people”.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he kicked a piece of wood hard, one that $he judged would not fight back. It broke and flew a few feet away, defeated.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the aftermath of $er catharsis $he felt edgy and tense. Unfulfilled. Alone. Everything felt dangerous in this world.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fucking eggshells._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Yes, something was wrong with $er and everyone saw it. Even the dog. Young children averted their gaze. Women made eye contact and then looked away or gave the look of fear.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Even Cat.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Rejected.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_There’s something so wrong with me.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What I dream of I can’t be that to have it, and I do what makes the dream impossible!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

One last scream escaped Mali, absorbed into the wind as if to confirm $er overall impotence in life.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What the fucking goddam hell is this shit?!!!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Approaching $er resort an older couple was sitting on the porch of their traditional yellow rustic house at the lot next door. Mali had noticed them in passing moments while sitting on the wall that afternoon.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The man spoke in Thai to his wife, “What’s the point of such misery?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The old woman shook her head.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali understood nothing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The full plastic water bottle exploded against the wall. As if in slow motion $he watched the water scatter, then what remained of the vessel ricocheted and as if in a final fuck-you landed on the bed where it emptied its remaining contents.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fucking testosterone, I fucking hate it!”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was easy to blame things on something that you couldn’t get away from. A slippery slope.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like my fucking shadow goddam it._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She had needed - actually counted on - finding some tranquility here and and come up worse than empty. The evening out had only accelerated the conflict and dysphoria $he’d sat in stillness with all day. $he knew things were advancing and it might be the last chance to…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Get off this train.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Before it was too late.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The maleness. The anger. The years of stuckness. So many years of feeling like $he was all wrong. Being told by therapists to ‘man up’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not a goddam dude. I don’t want to be a fucking dude. It’s not what I am._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And regardless of how much she wanted this, $he was crossing the line that did not have a way back.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Would I take a knife to the fish down there?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Emotion swung and $he started to cry.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Killing the fish once and for all.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fucking goddamit!!” $he yelled, losing any inhibition left.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In a moment of sobbing $he looked up at the dripping water from the sheets.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She cracked up, “Fuck! What are they going to think tomorrow!” she shook her head as $er laugher turned into crying again.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sad and twisted up and alone.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fuck. Oh well. They should have known already that I’m insane, ever since I arrived.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She lay on the floor shaking her head. Still laugh-crying but also starting to feel the bitter tinge of the aftertaste that such outbursts of anger and adrenaline brought. Rage always did that. There was always the crash. It felt bad in the body, and the soul.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It hurt so much because…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This isn’t who I am really._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It wasn’t a defense. It was actually true and she knew it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he closed $er eyes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And slept.
