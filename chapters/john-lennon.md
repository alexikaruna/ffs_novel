Mali stood at the front of the bus station under its shaded drive-through carport with a green tea latte in hand.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A large black Mercedes 500 pulled up. All tinted windows on the sides and even the front. It always fascinated $er, especially in third world countries, the affluence that would show itself on occasion. $he continued to sip and watch the morning traffic and movement of cars, tuk-tuks, mopeds and people as they came and went from the station, distracted.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he turned to a familiar voice, a bit hoarse and breathy, next to $er “Sawadee ka khun Mali ka,” with a bit of seduction and smile in it, even without seeing her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali half jolted at the surprise and proximity.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You didn’t see us pull up?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was wearing a form fitting one piece white cocktail dress, hemmed a few inches above her knees, matching white heels. And everything else black - beaded necklace, earrings and creative ring assortment, all onyx. Which brought out the dark of her eyes and laser straight hair which she was wearing down for once.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali was entranced as Cat gestured to the car $he came from. The 500, of course. Also apparently part of the outfit.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali finally came to and turned to her,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Hey you, _that_ is your car?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded, “My dad’s actually.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Dad._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Come on, come meet my sister.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Sister._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali exhaled for what seemed like the first time since learning they were going to a family place. As $he walked led by a Cat $he could not keep $er eyes off her. Not like ogling so much as simply in a kind of disbelief of the company $he had somehow stumbled into. $he did not feel like $he fit. The kind of woman and situation that would in most realities would not ever give $er the time of day.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But here I am._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat opened the back side door and chivalrously gestured Mali to get in. Cat followed and pulled the door shut with the kind of vacuum thud that only comes on a precision car. Next to $er on the far side, was a girl smiling and staring out the window, headphones on, oblivious it seemed. Kind of a tom-girl, she had rather short, wavy hair, an amazing profile, not unlike some of the most adorable Tom’s that Mali would see especially around $er old Bangkok neighborhood. Slender, boyish yet still feminine. Totally hot.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The resemblance to Cat was in her slender Thai figure and beautiful posture, yet with an edge.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali looked at Cat and they shared a smile at their aloof unicorn. Cat reached out across from Mali and pulled one of the headphones from her sister’s ear.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh, why you do that?” she reprimanded Cat, then smiling again, “you Mali?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded and smiled.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“This is my sister Kwanjai,”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cat, say Kwan, not Kwanjai, pleeeeaseee!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay, my sister Kwan,” Cat acquiesced, and Mali got $er first flavor of the sibling drama.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled and did the foreigner attempt at a wai, a bow with hands together, which made Kwan smile as she did the same only with full grace.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Kwan replaced her headphone, Cat came to Mali’s ear, “Kwanjay, bpen kon katoey.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I heard that!!!” Kwan complained, face and eyes facing directly ahead.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It’s okay, we joke all the time. In the end of the day, she’s totally beautiful, no?” Cat gestured with her jaw to Kwan, “And she knows it, so it doesn’t matter. She’s actually very smart too. She’s going to study medicine next year. Wants to go to Chula and become a surgeon to help people like herself… uh…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Really? Wow, that’s so cool.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah. I’m her best advocate. Making sure she studies and stays serious. My parents - they’re not so disciplined. Guess its the partial Japanese upbringing in me!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat changed the subject, “My father got excited and suggested that we take you to our restaurant, out in the countryside, when he found out you were coming to town, is this okay with you?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat looked to Mali questioning for the truth with her eyes, “Of course we’ll make sure you get back for your late bus, okay?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s brain circuits were getting fried at every turn, “Uh, of course! That sounds amazing.”, $he replied smiling.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat leaned forward over the front seat to speak to the sunglassed man who Mali only assumed must be the family driver based on his demeanor, dress, and the fact they were all in the back seat, “John, let’s go the nice way, okay?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And with the instruction the car was in motion.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“John?” inquired Mali quietly to Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah, his parents named him after John Lennon. He was born the day John Lennon was killed. We grew up together actually. He was like my big brother in ways.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Wow.” That was all Mali could say. A million questions which every moment seemed to divide into a million more.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As if reading Mali's mind, Cat brushed $er forearm, “Come on, let's enjoy the scenery for now, okay?”&nbsp;
