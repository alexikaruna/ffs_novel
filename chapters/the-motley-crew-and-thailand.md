Fate was set in motion at the LGBT dive in downtown Omaha. On the outside was was the rainbow flag, and in small almost invisible letters were the words _The Dive Club._ It was their place. A place where Jessi got along with everyone including the guys - _well they’re gay guys… gay guys are cool —_ and well… it was not like the West Omaha sports bars, or what Jessi would call, _prick gardens_.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I bet none of us have the balls to get the fuck out of here, not even for a minute!” Jessi placed her beer down in punctuation just a bit too forcefully, “I am so sick of all the bullshit. You know, even since that stupid thing on the playground, its like every man in town has to come after me. Thinking they have _something_ I want. Or fuck they are so studly they think they can ‘change me’ and their goddam Christian fuck-face conversion therapy bullshit,” the last words in air quotes, “And then turning rough when I turn them away as if the idiots are still trying to avenge their playground-retard ancestor. Because… because… they should freakin already know!!!” she ranted, “You know what, you know what? We should go somewhere where people smile and are just freakin happy! Whats the deal with this place anyway?”

They all knew that for some reason Jessi brought a lot of this stuff upon herself. The Omaha world was not overall horrible or angry. In fact it was an often unknown friendly gem of the Midwest, with a thriving liberal and LGBT community. The west-side conservatives aside. But the one truth is that Jessi did fight, if she had to, for equality and things that meant something. Aside from being attacked, then woe to the idiot. But also from some internal impulse of rage that even she couldn’t really understand fully. It just felt like she was being held back and frustrated by something.&nbsp;

Natalia smiled, humoring her, although she too would leave for her own reasons, “so where would that be?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Anastasia broke in excitedly, “I know, I know! Thailand! They say its the ‘Land of Smiles’,” she made finger quotes in the air, very happy with her recall.. from somewhere.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Hmmmm…” Natalia leaned over to go into her purse hanging on the tall chair and grabbed her phone. Clicking at the browser ‘images thailand’. And there they were.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh my god! Look at this?!” she overflowed, the other two pulling themselves almost on top of the tall bar table just like children, to get a view and the phone now placed flat in the middle, “Its beautiful! Yeah, I would smile all the time if I lived there too!” Pictures of pristine beaches, temples and smiling people filled the scrolling screen end to the end.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, Anastasia doesn’t have to go there, she’s, well, she’s never not smiling!” Jessi piped in.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So maybe she will get all serious and forget how to dance there!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I think we should go. I mean, we’re all at dead ends, right? You want to quit your job,” Anastasia eyed Natalia, “and you, miss warrior, you are tired of fighting, and me? Well, I just want to be alive finally and it feels like no matter how much or how hard I dance and jump, I get nowhere. There’s something in here,” motioning to her heart, “that tells me there is more than this. Maybe this is the chance?!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So it was settled. The three sat there, hovering over the Expedia site on the pathetic little screen, booked three round trip tickets to Bangkok departing the next week. To hell with passports and visas, they'd figure that out later. Done and done.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Jessi grabbed the phone, as the others complained, “Hold on! Hold on! Shhhhhh…” she admonished as if she going to dredge up the secret of the universe.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Images Thailand lesbians_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh my god!!!!”, Jessi crooned, “they are sooooooo cute!!!! I’m going and never coming home,” she touted the phone to the other two, “they’re boyish and prettier than the women here at the same time, no freakin way!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well I wouldn’t know about that, are the boys there cute?” asked Natalia.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Anastasia, the apparently more worldly one broke in, “The ladyboys!!! I wanna to see the ladyboys!!!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Everything went silent. The other two looked at her dumbfounded.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m just sayin!” Ana intoned a whine.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The phone was silently passed to her with pressed eyes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Thai ladyboys_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh my god!!!! Bigger oh my god than your oh my god, Jessi!!!!” she almost shrieked, discovering that ‘safe search’ was apparently off on this phone “Check them out, they are hot! They look like total girls, except for…” pause, long pause as she scrolled down, “Oh my god, next to some of them I look like a freaking guy!!!” she laughed full out, tears surfacing, “How about you Jessi, you’re going to get shown up! We’re going to have to _show ourselves_ to prove we’re girls!” The hyperbole not missed as all three were beautiful women in their own right. And another thing for sure: successful.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Natalia grabbed her phone, “Geez, its going to look like I was surfing for porn!”, she tried hard at the comeback, reddening with embarrassment as she realized mid-sentence she’d made a tactical error in the current company.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, you’re the one with safe search turned off!” returned Anastasia, pausing for effect, “nnnnnnnnn… Nataliaaaaaa!” ending the held syllable into a smile-laugh, “I mean... watch ya holding back from us?!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They were all virtually in tears not from any single thing but the combination. And so was the magic of the triad. The alcohol not hurting things. Nor the apparent craziness of their reckless travel plan. The three friends headed out of the club. There was nothing more that could be done that night to top the last hour nor were they going to attempt it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Jessi pulled on her leather jacket and got on her motorcycle. Anastasia in her black BMW 500, her ridiculous character foil, giving Natalia a lift to the start of the road about a mile from her house. The answer always being, ‘Why? because I like it, I like to walk’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

‘Insane’ thought Ana as she dropped her off. Natalia was of all of them the most successful and owned a small acreage at the edge of town.
