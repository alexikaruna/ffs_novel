<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The main area of Cat’s apartment was bordered with windows. The combined kitchen-dining-living room looked out on the Sukumvit area of Bangkok and in the distance the park they’d been at. Sparkling evening lights, the inching along of cars on roads and bypasses in the distance, punctuated by those in sibling buildings near and far. Drops of light rain spattered on and off against the outside glass making all out there seem like a snow globe -- Thailand version.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was in the open kitchen at the far left side of the expansive room. Apparently a corner unit. At the far end of the kitchen was a bar-counter all lined with windows on the far wall. Another counter, the main cooking one, closer to $er creating a divider to what could have been a living and dining room but purposed only as living space with a whole bunch of plush white pillows strewn around.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali stood in awe. It was the full package and then some. The place, and then Cat, in a white camisole and black leggings, hair pinned up stood at the counter island washing something in the sink. Mali shook $er head just observing, Cat not registering $er presence emerging from the hall at the other end of the room.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The perfect woman._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Whatever had been surreal already was not ending. She pinched herself again and $he knew $he was doing it… but it didn’t hurt at all. It was like being with Cat soothed and strengthened $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was not like such surroundings were totally out of her league.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She had lived - as ‘he’ - for several years in an apartment in San Diego several stories up and up a hill, overlooking the Pacific Beach ocean. Falling asleep to the sound of waves and the treasure of the cool tinge of the ocean breeze in the late afternoon and evening were familiar and everyday occurrences. Long walks after work to decompress on the beach. Even learning to surf. It was not that she was not accustomed to good things.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But since leaving ‘grace’ in San Diego, following after _this_ inside ‘$er’, not so much. Such occasions since then were more based on perhaps a company location in a high rise in NYC or being invited to the penthouse of acquaintances of friends.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But since imploding - self described words - ‘his’ life there, it had been on and off. $he made less money overall but more per hour. $he could have made more. But that wasn’t important to $er. But the rules were changed, and it was not about that anymore. Things that seemed to matter before - like building a career and a life, even having a home, a space in $er life for a woman to enter, no longer had the thrill and hold on her.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What was the point?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Partly from disappointment in the relationships ‘he’ had had, but also that $he couldn’t stop on this feminine path.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Something in $er longed for the security and comfort again that $he had had. Being beloved by her employer, working hard - sometimes to exhaustion - but for something. The last years too had been hard work, but for no one but herself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A code mercenary.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With the purpose just to figure $erself out, continue the path and carry on.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Do you know how many rules I’ve broken for you today?”, Cat broke Mali out of $er trip down memory lane Cat's space had inspired.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Uh… shall I imagine and count?”, Mali smiled, “But do friends break rules for friends? I thought that was a dating thing…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Busted.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, lets just say on external appearances. If you were a guy and I a girl. Or if you being a girl. Same difference.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or is it Cat... really?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“If we were into each other.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Their eyes locked for a long moment.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Keep going, so you were going to count?” Cat saved herself.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You do it. They’re your rules!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I am not sure even I can count. Lets see…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Being snippy in the clinic,” she thought about it, “no, that’s not really a rule, only being a bitch… I’m usually anti-bitch, you know…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Ah, but, being a pest in the park to you to get you to wake up,”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Holding arms and embracing in the park. You know decent Thai people don’t do that?!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Leading you like a child,” Cat laughed, “again, arm in arm,”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

"Pouring soda down my shirt!" Mali exclaimed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smiled widely in response, “bringing you home.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sharing my clothes, hinting to loose the stubble. Intimate clothes! Well…”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat chuckled finding irony, “hardly a man other than family has crossed the threshold of this apartment!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The last sentence stung Mali for a minute but $he let it go.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I don’t know what to say except that, I’m honored. Not only that, I can’t tell you how magic this afternoon has been… I promise you I will never forget it. Like when you took me with your family to The Restaurant. Maybe that helps assuage your outlandish actions?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled using Cat’s own wink-smile.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So do you like prawns?” Cat had turned, fumbling with the silver doored refrigerator.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You know, I don’t eat seafood really but fish. But you know also, in honor of Cat, I will eat anything you cook tonight with gratitude and I am sure it will be delicious.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay, so I will surprise you, huh?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah. Gosh. Whats happening to me. I am not a person who easily accepts surprise dishes!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Breaking rules, huh? Mali turning over a new leaf, in Thailand? Sudh can never be such a bad thing!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That’s a dangerous statement,” at which both laughed. Knowing what goes on on any given night in Bangkok.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A sizzle and spray of steam rose from behind the counter and Mali just let Cat do her thing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“If you want any help just let me know.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Do you cook?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah, I told you about my rice cooker?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali traveled with a rice cooker and made most of $er meals from oatmeal to rice noodle soup in it. $he loved it, but it did feel like slumming compared to the current environment.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But most of what I make is simple - vegetables, rice, noodles, some beef, fish, eggs. That kind of thing. My body is rather sensitive.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I can tell,” smirked Cat with her wink.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Do you like wine?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“A little. Red mostly. Sweeter the better. So you can tell my poor taste.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So port before dinner it is,” laughed Cat, “nice.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You have no idea. My favorite wine is the Jewish celebration wine. Its sweeter than grape juice, rather viscous and it doesn’t taste like alcohol. And pretty cheap.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, the sweeter it is the more intoxicating.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s eyes met hers, “Is that so?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So you are not worldly. But you are here in Thailand, half a world away from home. Out on a limb with yourself — am I taking too much liberty describing you?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No’m, that’s pretty much it,” Mali smirked, “the thing is I think in ways I am more like a monk in a temple than most people. I spend so much time alone, I love being up before dawn, practicing my qi gong and stuff. I love the early morning and the sunset, simple foods, long walks, being out in nature, in the forest. I mean, to me that’s really what makes me happy.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he added, “But sometimes - often - I feel like I’m not living. Like I’m practicing to live but not actually doing so. And then this whole as you say ‘out on a limb’ thing. Hard to have someone.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s outburst at the park was still at the forefront of Cat’s mind. So touching and honest. Somehow it resonated with how she felt too. Maybe everyone felt that way. But she did. For sure.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Such a dreamer. But I love it. So tell me about that special someone.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cute, playful and fun. Loves the outdoors. Unpretentious, down to earth. But you know… I can make lists but in the end when you meet someone, it all kind of goes out the window, don’t you think?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded, monitoring the stir-fry in the wok.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sometimes for the better, really.” Cat smiled softly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now that things had really broken open, she had to know more.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Have you started hormones or thought about it? Just, I have friends and well, most have liked men forever, and some that didn’t, started to.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah, I’ve been experimenting with them but low doses. I don’t have a doctor so am being very careful. I don’t want to look like a man with breasts. That just does not work for me. But my body loves the estrogen and seems to also love having less testosterone in me.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Has it changed who and what you want?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I feel better in myself with the hormones. But out there it takes someone very special to catch my attention. Few and far between. It’s always been like that,” Mali feeling emboldened locked $er eyes on Cat. $he hated being or feeling like a dominant ‘he’ in such a conversation. The instigator, aggressor or the one with an agenda. So $he decided not to.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You know I was wondering, sorry for all the probing questions, but do you think you’re too thin? Maybe that’s affecting things?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s heart missed a beat at the mention of the elephant that had been in $er own room for some time. $he feared this, especially if $he was to go for the major surgery. Just that something inside was sending a warning message, a little red blip on the dashboard that $he just ignored because there was too much else surrounding $er life situation, not to mention that little ‘other problem’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even with the increased diet as of late for ‘guy mode’, still very thin.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But $he would not have a belly or a more masculine appearing body and that is what more food seemed to do for $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“To be honest - and I have not trusted anyone, or really had anyone to say this to - but yeah. But I don’t want to look male,” Mali shook $er head, “Have a belly and still no butt! I mean, I feel overall good and have a decent diet. But yeah, its like something is off but I can’t get at it. Not in any convincing way.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Can I make a suggestion?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sure”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Maybe if you embrace more fully who you really are, you get on hormones fully, maybe have a surgery to soften your face. It could would work out a lot of these little problems. Too, you might know your true sexuality and romantic preference.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali loved that Cat called them ‘little problems’. Certainly reframed $er perspective. $he didn’t like the mention of $er romantic preferences. They hadn’t changed. $he didn’t want them to change. No, not the aesthetic $he loved women with. But saying anything would have no weight because truly $he had not been on a full dose of hormones nor for long.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You might be right. I just have no one here, no doctor I trust.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, it might not be the time yet, but perhaps soon you’ll find who you need. In fact… maybe I can help. You know Kwan.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Kwan.” Fuck. This was really close to home for Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You think you’ll get sex change?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No. It feels so invasive. I love my body and the sensitivity it has. It would scare me to mess with that, you know, its the nervous system.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Ka,” Cat said dreamily as if in another world all of the sudden, “Yes, oh I am sorry for all the advices, its not my style to be like this, but we’ve already broken so many social conventions that I feel comfortable, becoming an advising bitch,” Cat winked, and then shifted and looked intently back at Mali with a little mist in her eyes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“In fact Mali, I simply feel comfortable with you. I like you a lot. Its so confusing. But I’m starting to see who you really are. Very special.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Both had their their lower arms and elbows resting on the kitchen island, across from each other. Cat had forgotten about the cooking dinner. Mali had forgotten about hunger. Well, of the hunger for food at least.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The only hunger had always been the same hunger. $he could not imagine that longing ever changing but $he had to give credence to what Cat said about hormones. In a split second $he saw a path - a probable path - where this would go with Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Down the road that is screwed_.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m so in-between and shouldn’t have been by now. Damn it!&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Without $er katoey existence or questioning, this whole thing would probably be something real, with Cat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cuts both ways. Torn in two. Not a new feeling. Not a pleasant one either. Not a tolerable one.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But then again, without this journey, $he’d never have come to Thailand.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or even be here with Cat._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Suddenly they both caught eye of the cloud of smoke and a flame rising from the wok.
