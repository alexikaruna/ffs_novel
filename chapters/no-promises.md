Settling down on to the plush and soft white suede couch, Cat pulled Mali down by $er hand, next to her. She reached for the control and dimmed the lights.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled, “If I didn’t know better…”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But the whimsical comment was quickly extinguished by the intent force of Cat’s hand pulling $er in. It was the force of…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Beyond friendship._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Unequivocally and for the first time.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, I don’t know… I can’t promise you anything,” Cat whispered in $er ear, the heat of her breath searing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I mean, you make me ask all kind of questions of myself. Things that don’t make sense to me about myself either. You know, the day when you were playing the piano, it came to me that you were… seemed perfect. It just came to my heart, I didn’t think it.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She still had Mali’s hand pinned under hers, which made what she said next feel like inescapable torture.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But as a man. You have to know that might still be important to me, I don’t know. I’ve never considered that I could be with a woman or… much less a katoey. It’s just not…” she paused.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was just not even a concept - a katoey and woman couple - in Thai culture. Well, aside from Kwan.&nbsp;Which to date was untested and simply academic.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat felt frozen. An image of a snow globe of a man and woman couple she’d received from Netherlands came to mind. What was it that was going on here?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_With me?_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This picture… of life… my life… how things should be…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

How I want them to be…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This picture she held…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

While everyone around her who she cared for… Kwanjai, Koona, Mali, they were all… writing themselves out of the fairy-tale image one at a time.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And me???_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She couldn’t process it. Less now with the longing that had been brewing since the park this afternoon, that intimacy she finally had felt that she’d never had before. So she returned to what she knew.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“If you go on hormones, who knows what happens there? People change a lot when they do that. Kwan did. She liked men before she went on them. And now... nothing to do with them.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was looking directly now at Mali, in logical mode, building a partition, but really less one between her and Mali as one within herself.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What I am saying, is, I feel something strong with you now, in the present but I don’t want to hurt you,” her eyes becoming glassy with tears, “You’re too special, and I’m too…”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fucked up._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She couldn’t bear to say it. She was Cat, the poised and impeccable Japanese-Thai woman.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Or we can let this go and try to just be friends.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali spoke slowly for once,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You’re right.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

On one hand $he wanted to hold this woman forever on. But there was so much insecurity still in who $he was, or wasn’t. It felt so unfair. $he blamed $erself again, as always, for not knowing by now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“To be close to you, even for a moment, I’d do anything,” Mali started tearing up again.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was true in $er heart.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because for all intensive purposes $er life was meaningless and isolated. $he’d jump into the fire and not look back. If $he loved Cat in $er last moment, and they had this connection, it made everything right. Being together and held like it felt right now, close, in the last moment of life would make everything okay.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Would fix everything._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I just think I know what you feel — tonight — and really, I’d walk through fire to have it too.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat continued, “Do you have any idea how alone I feel in this world I’ve supposedly created?”, she gazed vulnerably into Mali’s eyes, as she, still holding Mali forcefully in place came closer, “I mean I'm so free, but still…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She opened light sobs, close enough Mali could feel the puffs of her breath. It wasn’t stupid, helpless crying, it had depth. Everything that Mali said she got. The double-binds, the heartbreak.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m no different really._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How different, Cat?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Its just not enough. Like you said, not enough for my heart. Nothing but the other is enough, I know what you mean. The jaydee thing and people being together for convenience, most of the man-woman thing we see, it’s sickening, it’s not for me. Thats all.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Koona’s friendship came to her mind. Irreplacable. Beautiful, tall, loyal Koona.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The rupture and scar that had healed over it was also sickening.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_By my own hand._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That was something she’d have to fix.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But not tonight._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali moved as $he could closer to Cat, also breaking into tears, her full lips pouting, at the moment they came together.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Is this what it’s like to be with a girl?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat pushed Mali back a bit to look at $er grey blue eyes,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You don’t make out, you just cry in each other’s arms?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali snorted. The two - and each knew - they had been coming in for a kiss and ended up blubbering for the last several minutes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled. $he’d never felt safe enough to really be $erself with someone. Even with $erself, alone, it was a long fought battle.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I don’t know. Only in my mind… in my dreams have I ever known.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded and angled her neck to come in for a contact that gently brushed by Mali’s lips.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Where she landed left only millimeters of distance, feeling the soft breath of each other. Mali gazed into dark chocolate eyes as Cat into the blue-gray heights of the sky.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat reached up to Mali’s arms and pulled $er in. It was the most close and together either had ever felt. And so much more poignant in the face of feeling both the warm connectedness of the now and the insecure and unknown future, with the monster of culture lurking somewhere in the background.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Finally brushing lips Cat fell over on her side with Mali landing just in front of her.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It wasn’t just Cat. Of course Cat was in front of $er, irresistibly beautiful, without makeup and in this seductive casual atire, but it was also also how $he felt in $er own ‘dress’. Like what things would have been if $he’d been able to hold off the effect of the world and others around over $er lifetime. The physical gridlock which gated $er more complete self-expression felt held in place by the world. As such this perpetual low level anger and tension. But now, surrender in $er inner pelvis was with the same abandon which melted the gridlock and tension in $er upper body. Cat’s loving presence was freeing $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They were slow in the time that ensued, like life had moved into expanded time and neither when reflecting later could recollect how long. A hand to brush up and land, with gentle pressure on the other’s arm or side. Eyes that met once and over again, checking in, gazing, longing. Long luxurious caresses which sent shimmers through the other’s spine. Then just smiling, taking a break before diving in again.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was unlike anything Cat had ever experienced, and exactly what Mali had on so many occasions imagined possible but never found. It was not hard, it was simple. Only prevented by an internalized hell of rules of engagement. Well, and an appropriate accomplice.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What made it right is they both knew that the other wanted the same and that it was okay. Everything they had shared over the months created a basis and depth impossible if this had been a first date. And so through the openness and intelligence of the two, the veil of culture and expectation was lifted.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because it's possible that two alone can decide their fate together.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If they so decide._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was as if in this slow coming together they were ironing off any rough edges between them, each body softening, toward the point where the others person, body, even spirit seemed more and more just like their own.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Whether it was a few minutes or an hour later, neither could tell, but the doorbell rang. Cat perked up at the sound and Mali reluctantly loosened what $he had hoped would have been a single eternal focus.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Who is it?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It must be a friend coming by to say hi,” Cat created a plausible story as Mali’s heart sank.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Why?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Why does she have to answer that?_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I thought we wanted the same._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The old feeling from $er first love surfacing, of jeopardy and heartbreak because the other cared less than $he did to be together.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_One always wants it less…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or in my case, at all._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he couldn’t move and just sat there staring at the vase on the coffee table, burning the pattern on it into $er brain as if it was analogous to this predicament, as Cat went to the door. Not really in a good place to greet anyone albeit a friend of Cats. But before $he knew it Cat was back with a pastry box and a large grin.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Dessert is _not_ optional! You must have been asleep when I called earlier. You’re gonna love this.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat stared at Mali’s state for a second and added,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And now I know you were enjoying yourself as much as I was. Should have seen your face when I told you a friend was coming by!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I told you I suck at lying! I don’t own my body,” Mali squinted one eye playfully.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I could live with that,” Cat brushed $er upper arm gently, the words and act, of course, making Mali forget that this was possibly _‘just for tonight’_. For a second $he felt insecure on another front that maybe this was just how the Bangkok culture worked and what was happening was nothing out of the ordinary for someone like Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I could just be another… flavor of the month… flavor of the night._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus Mali. You know who Cat is. her character, if you know anyone._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In a moment Mali relived the reality of everything to date that had been lived and transpire between $er and Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Here,” Cat with a wink-smile popped open the box as Mali observed her, slender and luxurious.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If this weren't happening... Out of my league, never even imagine..._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The box contained the most amazing looking thing with creamy white frosting.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“We need a fork?” Mali interjected as Cat reached for the cake.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Really?!” Cat raised her brows, indignantly as she broke of a piece with her delicate hand while sitting back down in the same motion.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With her other arm she pulled gently on Mali to sit up and come closer.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Here, try this, and tell me picky-eater that you don’t like it!” as she raised it to Mali’s lips. The white frosting belied a dark chocolate velvet interior, it was light, just sweet enough but not too much, with the consistency of a cloud.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_At least if I could eat a cloud this is what it should feel and taste like._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled now breaking a piece of it for her companion.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They fed each other pieces of the large slice until it was gone.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Really?!” Cat exclaimed as Mali had taken the wax paper out and was licking it, as it had still abundant frosting remaining.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It’s the best part!” Mali made a cheeky smile.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali in $er abandon had gotten a piece of frosting stuck to $er lower lip and before $he could lick it, Cat came in and gently sucked it along with $er lower lip into her mouth.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I think _that_ was the best part,” Cat looked seductively back at Mali who only now noticed that Cats hand rested on the mid-thigh of $er left leg $he had crossed under $er and was sitting on.
