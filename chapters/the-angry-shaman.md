Mali promptly excused $erself from the restaurant. $he felt pinned down and backed in a corner, not in a good way. Setting out $he just walked. $he could have taken a cab or the Skytrain but walking was $er medicine. The conversation with Cat only brought to a fever pitch $er own inner dilemma.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe I am like the Native American shaman who is not one sex or the other. Could it be that simple? Not have to do anything else?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Be with Cat wholeheartedly? Not have to be either?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If I had to choose would I be a man for Cat?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali knew even exactly how many cars, including the colors and how many windows and seats there were on this train of thought as $he began riding once again.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The front engine car always felt like hope. But by the caboose it was always a sucky and heartbreaking shit-show.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’ve lived it…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Through $er last two actual relationships.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was faster now running the scenario.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I know myself. It always starts in sexuality and ends in being feminine.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was no role, no bonding or fucking that ended in a happy ending as a man.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or in being anything than seen as female.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Maybe in Thailand than anywhere else, the man’s societal role could be worked around. Men could be softer here if they felt that way.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It was in the bedroom._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It had been exactly how that whole night happened. As $er armor fell, there was only what was left. $he knew Cat had truly seen who $he was.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And that’s why she disappeared._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And why she doesn’t want me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was undeniable and $he wouldn’t even try the mental gymnastics of earlier years around this one.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat doesn’t want what I am._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Who _would_ want that?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A woman that could have any man… heck, any woman she wanted?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Who am I deceiving?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he took a deep breath.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Every day, sometimes by the hour Mali felt the need to board this fucking train and ride it again, explaining once again everything to $erself. The WHY. It was essential and was required at a moments notice $he be able to do so.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Life is calling my fucking hand._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali kicked the pole as $he walked by the now familiar park gate. The late evening was cooling ever so slightly to a pleasant eighty-ish degrees.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Just bend me over and fuck me. Just fucking do it,” $he was speaking angrily under $er breath,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fuck you!!!” $he raised $er eyebrows, looking toward the sky and made a bit of the finger gesture, just from the hips in taut but controlled aggression.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then realizing to who $he was addressing and the role $he attributed to them, it inspired $er anger to rise the necessary magnitude to confront the heavens.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Universe, god, whatever the fuck you are why do you keep me here? Fuck me! Why don’t you just put me out of my goddam misery once and for all? I can’t fucking win. You bitch slap me whichever direction I turn.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fuck you. Goddamn you!!! Just fucking do it. Put me the fuck out of my misery.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was screaming at the top of $er lungs before $he realized it.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Straggling late-night passerbys turned. In Thailand, anger was pretty much the last resort to anything, something the culture avoided except at the extremes. Expressed anger to another person could turn out to be very dangerous.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But given that the strange farang was yelling to no one in particular, those around with an almost imperceptible tic of the head simply turned on their mental erase and continued on with life deleting the episode.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She walked on into the late evening reminding herself again,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I know she feels for me, feels deeply for me. And I do for her.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The mantra which made the tears and uncontrollable sobbing break through the cloak of rage and run its course.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The one redeeming thing was the warm light she felt inside, the warm light that Cat herself had brought her closer to…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Myself._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That in here somewhere is someone to be treasured.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Who could make things better, all around, unconditionally, always, up to the very last moment.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Oh, how good that sounds._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali finally made her way to the skytrain station and her lips turned up in her first smile in hours, never one to not delight in the irony of life however painful.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Yes, the perfect woman.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But who was the perfect woman?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She heard immediately in her head the name Ana.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Ana?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Who is ‘Ana’?!_
