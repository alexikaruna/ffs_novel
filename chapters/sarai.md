Over these days at the resort, one of the visits to the past $he made was to Sarai, the first transgender woman the 'he' of back then was with, one of the handful of events that started making ‘being a man’, in romance and sexuality, something that could not be returned to...

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They stood in front of each other, the two virtually equal in height. No heels involved.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She was everything Mark imagined from the pictures she’d sent. A complete woman. Beyond even. And in their short coffee date, he already knew she was a woman he’d want to get to know and spend a lot of time with if she felt the same. Columbian with dark eyes and a face which was a mix of feminine beauty, and a masculine streak here and there, especially that angular jawline. She was striking. Perfect.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He had had few real interactions with transgender women and there were still a lot of questions floating around inside, not helped by the web and media, questions like 'are male-to-female transgender women were really women?'. And if they were real, 'is being transgender a real phenomena or a pathology?'. Not to mention the body question, 'what is real, and what is just porn and photoshop?' It was already a mess in his head.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But it took Mark less than a second in front of Sarai to know one absolute answer.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If Sarai was not a woman, then you’d have to dismiss most of the genetically female world as ‘not women’ also._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was this combination… this mix of feminine energy wrapped and laced with just some masculine, in the physical and all the way to how she spoke and emoted. Her husky voice could have been tell for ‘gay’ on a man, but was extremely sexy in a female. He’d never met anyone remotely like Sarai and never imagined how he could feel in such a presence.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But the tone changed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The innocent coffee date had turned into a make-out session right there at the table, led by Sarai to where they were now. It wasn’t perhaps what Mark would have initially chosen - to date, get to know each other and maybe become a couple - but there were some things he needed perhaps before and couldn't resist the flow.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The two were already undressed virtually before getting through the door of Sarai’s apartment. Mark had been stumbling around to explain his own years of confusion, the ‘why’ of seeking out to date transgender women, per Sarai's request, as things were becoming increasingly sexual.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, I…” he stumbled, himself at the time at the peak of whatever masculine he was capable, “I guess I feel feminine inside and I just want to…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sarai interrupted, “I know what you want,” she cooed sensually, reaching down to pull aside the front of her thong to reveal a beautiful penis, worthy of being called female. It _was_ exactly what he wanted. She was completely smooth and smelled amazing. It was perhaps even not so much the object, but the energy behind it, her strong hardness the figure and symbol of explicit feminine desire.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How I want a woman to want me._   
T_o want to take me._   
_To be powerful and strong enough to take me._   
_To be able to surrender in her arms._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Yet in her kiss and her heart, all the softness, warmth and beauty of female._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Things I have never felt for a man, no matter how I've tried._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Most of all and unconsciously to Mark she was the closest mirror he had to his own inner being. How he felt inside and the fact of of the existence of his own penis. Although of course there were many differences between them, but regardless this felt...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like home._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mark kissed her softly and then slowly made his way down her smooth and very firm body, another major turn on. Under her bra were slight breasts. To him she was perfect, like an athlete, the exact kind of figure that felt so right. He kissed her nipple on each side and continued to make his way down her toned abdomen.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mark had tried on a couple occasions in past years to be with men, both of which were complete disasters on all levels - romantic, sexual and aesthetic. There was no real turn on, nothing and no one to get lost in. No one he wanted to come back to and hold after making love. But making his way to Sarai’s penis, everything was completely different.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He wanted her. Not just her sex, he wanted _her_. It was the first time in his life the sexual and romantic seemed to fit.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And it felt so good to have her in his mouth. Amazing. Natural. Totally natural. Totally free, uninhibited. As good as he imagined it would be. He sucked on her but in not long, Sarai took control and holding his head, thrust herself into his mouth and down his throat. There was something primal in the almost gagging sensation of encompassing this beautiful being, taking her in fully. He would never forget the hard softness and kind of smoky taste that came along with her penis.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was nothing emasculating about serving this woman.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was no one there to emasculate.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But nevertheless, this was him. If anything this was the truest part of his nature he’d ever experienced.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This act he’d imagined and run from for so many years, so confused, thinking to feel this way meant he was gay. More confusing was the affinity he felt for beautiful transgender women. But there was always a stop right there. There was no way he could ever become close to what one of these women were. And the almost seemingly impossible task of finding someone in person who was like this. Until now.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But in the moment this was not a thought as he’d checked his mind at the door. He came up to embrace and kiss Sarai, still feeling her steel-like hardness against him still.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Being here was the most life - and self - affirming thing he had ever done.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In just a few moments, Sarai with her gorgeous feminine beauty, warmth and hard penis undid the houses of cards been built by $er therapeutic ‘support’ over the years. All the warnings and cautions, injunctions and tacit shaming for this being his own nature.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Sarai guided him to the bed for what was next, he breathlessly whispered to her, tears in his eyes, “I don’t know why I have waited so long!”.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Why did you?” she breathed, raising an eyebrow, but it was rhetorical.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now on the bed, she raised his legs, and slipping on a condom, forcing herself into him. It hurt a bit. Too much, too fast. For a second he let it happen and then complained “Ow, it hurts!” His own true fantasies as always in lovemaking were way more gentle, sensual and soft between partners. But nevertheless, he was still riding the moment.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Take it like a man,” Sarai laughed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali winked and gasped, “if you even knew.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But Sarai didn’t really.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But he loved how she felt, and how he himself felt. Especially pulling her to him in a kiss as she penetrated, as he embraced her with his legs. He was breathless. He'd never been breathless with anyone.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Something in life for once felt right._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Afterwards, he found a new comfortability and peace with men.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The next day while sitting with his roommates in their shared Upper West Side apartment, the change was apparent. Living there was by convenience more than anything really in common with the frat-types his roommates were. But sitting there shooting the shit in front of the TV with them, he was a different person.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He didn’t tell them what he’d been up to the night before or anything. He didn’t have to, there was no need. No apologies or neurotic thoughts either. Where always in the past he felt rather uneasy around them - and men in general, the 'am I hiding being gay' question and all that shit, tonight he felt confident and self assured. Even if they came to know, he wasn’t embarrassed, in fact was proud of the last twenty-four hours. Something in his pelvis was solid, grounded. Having been used the way it would seem was intended.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He’d be absolutely honored to have Sarai as his girlfriend. Publicly, everywhere with him.&nbsp;And he hoped for that. He was hoping to hear back from her at the moment even.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He’d always been confused with the feminine aspect of himself, especially the desire to be taken or penetrated. He knew now without a shadow of a doubt he wasn’t nor would likely ever be attracted to these men, or any man. Only that before this time these strange feelings made him wonder if he was really a repressed gay man.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was something to knowing and embracing what he was, what had been driving him and once expressed, a certain security had come over him.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Even if it isn’t the whole picture…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was still not who he was - he was not a guy who likes getting fucked.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A girl?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If he could have flipped a switch in that moment and become a woman for the rest of his - her - life, he would have right then. It was that clear.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Being a woman. Loving Sarai._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Of course what would come in the next days was to wax his body, get more smooth and more slender, more female. Sarai was a woman, there was no conflict in his mind about this. It wasn’t about Sarai’s penis as much as the fact that she could, and did take him.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And because I don’t have to use mine, I can just be myself. Use it or not use it, it doesn't matter, not like with being a 'ma_n' _for a woman._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Express._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And be taken._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Feel her power._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Surrender to her._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Feel alive._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Feel soft._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Any woman with that energy going forward in life, that was the kind of woman he wanted. Be they transgender or genetic females, it didn’t matter.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He even revised his concept of who could be ‘the one’.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But only… they have to see me as a woman._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I don’t want to be humored._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A past girlfriend had been game for the role reversal. And she was awesome for it, but Mark knew that was not what really did it for her. And for him it was critical to…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Be wanted. Desired._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Taken.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That way.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_As a woman… by a woman…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sarai lost interest as soon as he started his own way toward the feminine.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sarai wanted a guy.&nbsp;That became clear. It didn't matter what other things 'he' was.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was Mark that turned her on, just as it was with every other straight woman over his life. The story held…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The more I express as I am, the more I will distance myself from who I truly want - a woman, be they transgender or genetic.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And I’m not going to be humored by a woman who can pretend I’m a woman.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not going to be with Cat who will see me as a male rockstar.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not going to be with a Sarai, me being outwardly a guy but not inside…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It’s just not acceptable.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So of course the problem was then as was now…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Where does that leave me other than with a knife in my hand and a seemingly impossible task ahead?_
