Outside the steel fence, the tranquil greenery abruptly ended and the concrete jungle began. The park was bordered on three sides by the gigantic ‘tanons’ - boulevards - the same of which could be found all over the city. Cars - many cars - densely populated the road, coming into existence just as the light of day too had come to pass.

_Rot tit.&nbsp; &nbsp;_

Mali smiled at the Thai words for traffic jam.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Synonym: Bangkok.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When: Always.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Where: Every major street that leads anywhere directly.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The taxi drivers were always amused when $he’d spout the word. It was one of the ways $he knew to create good feeling and commonality which was highly valued in the Thai culture.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Where there was not ‘traffic jam’ were mazes of side streets and alleys which only the most experienced taxi drivers could use effectively as many of the little portals ended abruptly. But some didn’t and the navigation by some of these drivers to Mali bordered on genius. These side streets or “soi’s” were finishing touches on a city and country which Mali had in earnest started to believe that many things had been arranged by some Machiavellian mastermind to keep foreigners in an at-best confused twilight.&nbsp; Busses with one name but variable routes. Words that $he could pronounce but no one could understand. Transliterated signs with letters that did not come close to the actual sound of the word - not in the Thai alphabet, not in the phonetic alphabet and certainly not in English!&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All part of the fun and mystery.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not to mention the juxtaposition of the apparent respectful status toward foreigners and at the same time the sense of them being the primary joke of the natives. Of the kindness in one minute and then virtually being laughed at to $er face, with Thai words $he was assumed not to know.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As always, walking in these post-standing moments, $er body felt at its best, strong, aligned, cohesive, even graceful as $he began the twenty-something minute trek.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he passed the bus stop and the lines that had formed to board ever crowded and rather old busses with destinations to the nether-regions the giant unknowable city. Whereas in Mexico or other countries $he could find $erself intrigued by the busses, their numbers and the names of destinations, these days and here, they held very little interest. If nothing else it was simply too hot to make geographic exploration much fun.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Some eyes of those in line rested on $er as $he passed but it was okay.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It meant $he looked good, tall, graceful, maybe even strong. When they were just eyes, not words, they were like a Rorachach to $er inner state.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Eyes are okay when you feel good, have poise and grace.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Soon $he was back to the preferred solitude as $he upped the steps of the first of two expansive pedestrian skyways which criss-crossed above the tanons and would deliver $er to Tanon Latprao, which would lead back to the hotel.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Making $er way up the second skyway, the panorama was simply city, morning sunlight came from somewhere beyond in the forgotten sky. Two large shopping malls, several skyscrapers with the rest being two or three story serial buildings, the kind and style that seem to populate many large cities, roll up door bodega shops on the first floor with a few floors of apartments above.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A woman passed by on her way across the bridge and stared. The long held stare. An enabled stare. The one that says you may as well be an inanimate fucking object. Mali was often conscious of the fact that in a split second when receiving such a look if $he added a smile it could turn into a heart-filling moment of connection. Unfortunately even now $er defenses did not permit such.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And why the fuck does it always have to be me who smiles first???_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In $er mind they were different, but for $er sensibilities now over half a year into $er Thailand journey, it was a tie between the inanimate object stare and being laughed at and talked about just feet away. They both in the end led $er to the same place.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt the minute anxiety and accompanying tension of defense raise. It always was disheartening. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And the story of my life.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was not just Thailand.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the US and other western countries, people would tend to look away sooner. Here not so much, added to the mix that people would often laugh or even say words to their companions in plain ear sight. $he did not know all the details but enough times the words farang, katoey and laughter paired made a plausible story. It hurt here as with everywhere. The difference was that here it didn’t feel dangerous as it did in the USA, although for some reason it hurt more.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I know they’re calling me a transgender foreigner. Thats okay in theory, aside from the inanimate object stares._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But fuck the laughter._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was like people there often seemed to feel they had the right to stare, do double and triple takes with $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Gets fucking old…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And although $he was no stranger to relative isolation in $er life, isolation of course made it worse here. So over time, in the day to day, with the culture here $he could only characterize it for $erself as polarized love-hate. Or love-anxiety relationship, punctuated with uneasiness and feeling ashamed when $he seemingly overreacted from what $he held in.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he remembered the day in this general area $he’d walked with a friend from Thai class, a tall and quite attractive woman. $er friend had also been stared at and on an occasion called katoey. Mali smiled at the memory. On one hand it helped to know… that it happened to genetically female foreigners too here. On the other…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_They’re still gender categorization obsessed assholes._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In Thailand $he appreciated the crazy amalgamation of new and old, modern and traditional. The deep history and Buddhism, the dark unknowable alleys of the city as the Thai psyche itself paired with the most modern, over the top malls, technology centers and innovation. Superior street food outside of five-star glitzy restaurants. Not to mention their polarized femininity and masculinity coupled with what seemed like everything in between. Tom’s and Dee’s, gays and katoeys.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And to this mess, add a heaping measure of self-consciousness. Image.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The selfie-culture.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Insecurity, especially in the heteronormative young, female world which $he had grown to dislike, the ultra-feminine, temperamental and at least superficially vapid young females who did nothing apparently than shop and text. All this made $er feel less feminine than $he felt in the US due to the divide.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But then there were others, the LGBT types $he’d come across in the 7-11’s, cafes. And so many good natured people in their forties and above. So in short whatever anger or frustration would boil over in Mali would be checked regularly with shame when $he met with kindness and what seemed to be a genuine smile and connection.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just like my own volatility and insecurity.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This place is a perfect reflection.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Don’t even think of leaving here until you’ve worked yourself out._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali warned $erself about this regularly. It was the intuitive and unwritten deal $he had with $erself that $he was going to resolve $erself here and soon. And not leave until then. $he had a habit of moving and was starting to wonder if it too wasn’t an escape.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Running away.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_This place is the best chance I have.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like it or not._

Mali was no stranger to surreal living and the sometimes floating feeling about $er life, in Thailand exacerbated by low cost of living relative to almost any major city in the world. Mali, then Mark, had left the normal ‘job’ life in 2009 and began freelance programming to support $erself. Self-trained, $he had wondered if $he had what it took. But $he got one client that lasted a couple years, then another, then another. All of which enabled first a new life in NYC, then as if to push the boundaries, $he went to live in $er old love, Guadalajara, Mexico.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The problem was… it worked. $he didn’t miss a beat with $er client. This fueled the fire of pushing boundaries virtually at-whim, city and country hopping for the last five years. And in the meanwhile finding the freedom to explore $er identity more. At least in appearance. It was amazing what you could do to be free if you had money and could be virtually anywhere.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In $er words it was ‘simple living’ but $he generally went where $he wanted, when $he wanted, saving a good amount of money on the way due to making $er US contracting rate. In a way $he started to understand how it might feel to be wealthy or a celebrity and have so much freedom of time and location.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But the flipside was - just as with the celebrities - that sanity could also at times seem like a relative thing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like tonight may be._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was virtually guaranteed to be.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But the unknown was in which direction.
