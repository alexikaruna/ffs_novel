_All living things fear being beaten with clubs. All living things fear being put to death. Putting oneself in the place of the other, let no one kill nor cause another to kill._&nbsp; — Buddhist saying

“500 baht” the driver was adamant.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Peng mai?” Mali arched brows and intoned.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No expensive, it far! 10 keelomiter…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Finally agreeing to the fare, now in the cab, Mali shuddered. Another mistake? $he was generally good at intuitively making decisions, in quick time and good results. But, $he sighed, here it could make sense. Under such felt pressure and duress to stay away from Chiang Rai at all costs, it would be easy to have followed a suboptimal path.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Running from was different than running to.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Which one was this?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Whichever one it was, this one was not fully baked. But that could be said about the depressed rock-bottom $he felt in regards to $er life in general lately. $er rock bottom, not unlike walking in a creek bed of sharp rocks, you don’t want to move too much and certainly not too fast.

Arriving after thirty minutes, the fare clearly earned, the resort looked nice but lifeless. The taxi pulled up on a gravel parking area in the arriving twilight. To the left the road and the ocean, and to the right, what looked like a pristine - but completely vacant, sparsely lighted resort. $he assumed in the city of Hua Hin there would be movement and many tourists and the whole Thai-massage-expat-geezer scene there $he wanted no part of. $he wanted quiet and tranquility.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was _that_ and some. $he walked up the path to a pool area, actually beginning to wonder if the place was not actually shutdown. It was not run down, just completely devoid of life.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he finally saw a solitary employee at the bar.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I have reservation” Mali spoke slowly in tourist English but without meaning it, let the tone be tainted by $er anxiety, as was not uncommon, causing an even more male voice, leading on one more level to being misunderstood for the person $he felt $he was and wanted the world to see.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The man seemed confused as if to say ‘we’re not expecting anyone’.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A chord played in Mali’s body. Alone, deserted.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not wanted.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But $he did not know $he felt these emotions, all $he felt was annoyance coupled with self-consciousness.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_There’s something wrong with me. And everyone sees it._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just for being alive.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Here_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_At all. Just by nature._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Perfect._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali considered the possibility that $he really was not expected, but insisted again as $he really had nowhere else to go easily. Finally the bartender pointed and motioned by hand ‘that way’.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As $he walked, it became clear that the entire resort was barren of people, not just the pool, but everywhere. $he might be literally the only one there. Aside from the scare of such desolation, there was a quiet tranquility to the place.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he walked, following the ‘directions’, over a wooden boardwalk, through the tropical garden which encompassed all the property and hotel buildings. The place was composed of many individual buildings, most of them roundish or octagonal, two stories, white with wooden trim and roofs. They were all dark in the windows.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

&nbsp;Aside from the conspicuous absence of clientele, it seemed to be an ‘A’ resort. Everything was clean, well maintained and basically pristine.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he heard a murmur of water as $he noticed that alongside the path was a man-made brook, running the length of the property too, winding under the boardwalk path as it needed in order to stay unbroken by buildings and other obstacles.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All of the sudden, what $he saw paralyzed $er heart and made $er stop in $er tracks. Unable to move a step further $he sat down right there, in place where $he was.
