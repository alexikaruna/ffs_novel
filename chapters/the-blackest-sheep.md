The forth day of solitude finally came…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali had climbed over the balcony outside $er room to a ledge $he’d found large enough to sit on. It was actually a fence, some artificial division of the property for whatever reason but had a ledge and a back as if it was a bench. It was surprisingly comfortable $he had discovered in past days, aided by a pillow and a couple towels $he had brought over.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was $er last day of the lonely and unproductive retreat.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Where in the past solitude had allowed $er to work things out, the current was unworkable no matter what $he tried. $he’d escaped Chiang Rai and then Bangkok to this god-forsaken place carrying high hopes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_ **Going to hell** _

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had written it and now etched it indelibly by going over and over it again and again by pen in $er journal.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

"Going to hell," $he said absent and dreamily, half aloud, and then angrily…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

"This right here is fucking hell… there’s nowhere else to go!"

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Which is how in recent years, mostly unconsciously, $he had felt about $er life… into the gutter… the sewer. Not in small part by being affected by those around $er who had no way of really seeing what was inside and who saw a man still. All the gay-friend-zoning of woman. The not infrequent noise and pokes on the street.&nbsp; Being called or assumed gay, even by the well-meaning. People on the outside did not seem to get $er, or see where $he was going.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Trying to go._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Could go…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For a moment $he contemplated the magazine model who for all Mali had presumed,&nbsp;caused that fucking Chinese Tune to start playing._&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The ‘going to hell’ period started in earnest after things broke open a few years back. $he dropped the external ‘help’ - therapists, bodyworkers, psychic chiropractors, teachers and whoever.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All this stuff that years had shown impotent against the fem in $er. $he’d finally grown wary and smarter. The new age way of thinking that all you have to do is flip some switches in your mind and everything will resolve and you get your hearts desire - to be whole, enlightened, your soulmate, yada yada.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The (fucking) Secret._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Nope.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_More like Victoria’s Secret._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not only did the shit not work, $he hated feeling so dependent on others. Not trusting yourself has a deep price and $he’d begun to feel it as too painful to continue. Too $he was sick of having to pay all this - money and time just to be ‘okay’. Moreover, $er deep conviction of self-determination was always undermined by being geographically not to mention financially tied to whatever practitioner $he was currently seeing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Ironically, ‘going to hell’ started at the same time $he started trusting $erself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And although $he did not realize it at the time, within months of taking responsibility for $erself and $er power back, $he quickly gravitated more decisively than ever to the fem and more than not stayed there because there was no one to pull $er back with their voodoo-new-age-psycho promises of something better. No breadcrumbs of hope sprinkled anymore by the bygone weekly therapy sessions. $he did just what $he felt like doing bit by bit more over time, and which brought $er to… here.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Female clothes, then makeup, waxing and laser… hair-loss meds, the hair transplant…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he vividly remembered the moment, years back now, on a walk to downtown Guadalajara en route to the used bookstore street when $he apologized to $erself for what was coming,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_‘Sorry but I’ve got to do this even if its against you, life and even this dream - the most important dream - in my heart. Wherever it leads me.’&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It wasn’t a religious thing. It was about himself - herself - dreams and longings.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Going against the core dream.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Her._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The longing for a romantic love with a beautiful and special, warm woman. True connection and deep intimacy. Of a simple life. Maybe a family. In Guadlajara.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This all contrasted with who ‘he’ was if he accepted he was not a cisgender or perhaps straight man. ‘He’ still felt more real back then. It was all a conjecture - $erself against the world basically. This inexplicable pull toward this…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Definitely felt like going out on a limb.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So it wasn’t so crazy $he’d attached the term ‘going to hell’ to the journey. Because it was a scary thing. To do on $er own.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he knew even then that ‘sin’ meant only to go against self. So $he did not need dogma, or any other human being…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Just integrity and an ear open always to what’s going on inside._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And trying to ignore the noise from the outside…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To date $he knew deep inside that in all this over the years $he was being true…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I have not sinned on this journey… mostly at least._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But I’m so afraid of making a bad and permanent decision._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Thats what it was. Albeit against the mainstream world, everything came naturally, on $er own with barely any input from others. Being a tech nomad already for some time by the ‘going to hell’ point, $he did not belong or visit virtually any LGBT or transgender community or events.&nbsp;There was virtually no direct external influence or pressure.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Heck, I’ve never even been to Pride yet._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Pride in fact scared $er for the most part and the idea of going made $er even more self-conscious of being presumed male-gay.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So it really only left one very important question now…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Was there an alternative to ending up here? To going further on this road… where things will permanently change, like it or not._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali by this point was pretty sure there were no mistakes in the universe. Who and how we are born. Born gay. Born straight. Lesbian. Bi…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But transgender?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Transgender was the bastard stepchild, the blackest of black sheep. The one with an additional layer of existential problems.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If it was even real._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The last time $he’d checked it was still a disorder in the DSM.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But if one was basically born transgender and it’s a real thing, where is the natural remedy?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If you’re gay or lesbian, even bi, you just go about doing you. Yeah, there are physical things you might change. Things that may draw attention to you for good or bad for sure. Certainly could bring ostracism and discrimination, even horribly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But trans, do you suck it up and accept the original equipment? What about the original biology? Hormones? Do you let yourself be and become what nature will or has turned you into if you don’t intervene?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And what do you do if you do go forward and intervene… and none of it is enough to heal the wound?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Is being me more important than having the chance to love and be loved? To love and be loved by the person, the gender I adore?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Everything had been right in $er before the puberty changes. $he remembered $erself in sixth grade photos, around twelve years old, a cute tom-boy… who could be mistaken for a girl. And then $he had to witness progressively becoming what $he wasn’t, didn’t feel to be, even despised.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Before all this I’d been pretty.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It wasn’t about being a boy or a girl per-se. As a child Mali felt so much more solid than now. $he assumed the sexually submissive feelings, even the girls clothes $he’d enjoy dressing in… were things everyone, boy or girl felt and did. $he’d even imagine having a girlfriend and being together with her exchanging clothes. It was all possible and all fine.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he still carried that sixth grade picture of $erself in that navy and aqua colored pullover and $er OP shorts. $he’d do anything to have the face $he did back then. Even $er neck was smooth and soft.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So if you believe biology should not be messed with and then you yourself watch before your own eyes as you become abhorrent to yourself…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

You have a real conflict to face.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All the new age and psychologist bullshit she’d bought into could not reconcile that one. There seemed to be barely a surgeon who now would take on bringing $er back to the ‘before’ condition.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he’d been so insecure. Even spent two years paying some dousche who'd been to Tony Robbins and studied applied kinesiology to ‘figure $er out’.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck if I want to look like a guy! Much less a gay one._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Mali, just accept yourself as you are.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck that.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not a gay dude nor do I want to be seen as one.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_No girl wants a gay guy… other than for a friend-zone or a haircut!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus fucking christ!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was already a pain point, all the friend-zoning…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The assumed gay friend… The assumed ‘likes men’ transgender friend…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck that and now!!!_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In more recent years, before ‘going to hell’, conveniently coinciding with making good money, $he did find more women interested in $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Women who wanted to be taken care of.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I didn’t fucking sign up for that shit-show either._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s programming, $he’d realized over time, had never been toward the dynamic $he finally saw between men and women when $he did get into more serious relationships.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt angry and wanted to lash out and hit something.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Feeling so misunderstood and not being able to do a damn thing about it._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not who I appear like in life nor how I am treated._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And the last bullshit psychologist in Brazil $he’d contacted, $he’d actually had the good sense to tell off.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

‘_Just do hormones. No surgery. Be as you are.’_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A man with breasts?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As in the words on Stuart Copeland’s drum heads…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**“Fuck Off You Cunt”**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he’d actually grown balls apparently since arriving in Thailand.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he smiled…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I am growing._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck that I even need to talk to someone or present my case to know what I am._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But nevertheless, $he was the one who’d sought out the others. Blindly following.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then came the last and latest possibility $he’d found on the web which still haunted $er: Attachment theory.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Is all this just some unfinished or unfulfilled issue from childhood? Needing mommy or a woman so much that I need to become the woman I am thirsting for? Because she doesn’t exist or can’t exist?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Could I be that wounded?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And Mali how much more money, do tell, would it take to figure out this is also not the answer?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Truth was, if this were true, Cat should have solved most of that problem. And to date Mali was no less who $he was, if not more complexed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although $he could still access the dream, the hope for ever having that _normal_ life $he dreamed of was in shambles.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Too many things had been done. Too much water under the bridge in the ‘alternative’ journey.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What if I got ‘cured’?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In a relationship, with a new woman, ‘he’ would have to tell her about all this. Not doing so would be a major withhold and against the intimacy and transparency $he’d always dreamt of.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even $er own bullshit indicator red-lined now even to the passing thought that $he could ever pass $erself off to a woman as a straight man.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he would not give up hormones nor medicine to prevent hair loss nor body waxing. $he wanted to be penetrated. And to be a woman while being penetrated!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And be so with a woman._
