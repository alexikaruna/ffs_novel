Mali held her breath.&nbsp;Unsure if K was there, or would talk to $er. But the fact that the connection seemed to be working was encouraging.Seconds seemed like hours but then it came…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** My god, is this who I think it is?!!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then quickly followed by...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**KO:** So you got my email?!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali exhaled and relaxed back in $er chair and smiled.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

K’s IRC, she seemed always to be on, going on six years back, in a different place, different life. A life, a place, $erself another person almost. Where they’d actually met for the first time. As well as the last time they’d chatted when Mali decided to move on from $er San Diego life.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The surreality of a past long ago juxtaposed with the sights and sounds of Chiang Rai outside $er window, with who $he was - had become now - was almost too much to coalesce.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Our last in-person conversation…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It started out with K pretty much going on and over $er head about the benefits of PostgreSQL as a database over MySql and Sql Server. Standing outside the datacenter in the middle of the night waiting for a deploy to finish…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And then K’s little aside about the strange sounding Ruby on Rails web framework.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Its a different way of thinking and interesting, you should check it out.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Ruby on Rails - RoR as many would call it, came to enable $er career in passion and freedom, enabling everything that came next. Up to becoming a contract worker, getting a decent hourly rate, enabling remote work, which seemed to be possible further and further from $er original home, then abroad... anywhere with a connection.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali shook $er head.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was all back in ‘his’ San Diego days, more or less, while at least trying to appear as a man. Surfing. An apartment overlooking the ocean. April, ‘his’ doctor turned girlfriend.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And the implosion of everything $he had still not gotten over.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All in contrast to sitting in this darkened room in a remote Thai town, in the middle of the confused and broken signals inside $erself and with the world that had only multiplied since that time.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Karina was known as ‘K’ to the world. Not ‘Kay’ but the letter K, as she would emphasize.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

K had been mostly only a work colleague - in fact not really that exactly - K was on the staff of a hired consulting company brought on to help Mark and his company maintain and keep the servers for the application he created online. Basically K saved Marks ass and his job over and over and made him look good.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They’d had had a few closer conversations, to know that Karina the woman existed inside her geekily impenetrable and unapproachable exterior and intimidating persona.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She was average height, but her face, the distance between her eyes and brows was close, giving her a serious, dominant rather masculine aspect. Then countered with irises of what seemed like marbled brown, perceptive and enchanting, and full feminine cheeks especially when she would smile. She was truly beautiful to Mark, and completely off limits in every way possible.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not only out of his league and not to be approached. Not to mention ridiculously intelligent, quick and ever so professional.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And not to mention gay._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mark had learned this one late night, around 3am at the datacenter, waiting for a painfully slow system patch to be applied. Like it was yesterday. It was Mark who saw something sad about K that night. She had been kind of off, snapping at him and sighing, as if he was such a burden, or the task maybe.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Ah but of course to Mark… to me… everyone’s displeasure is about me.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

K always kind of had him on edge. But that night was something else though. Perhaps because something had broken in K's own facade, one surfaced in his. He genuinely liked her, like maybe a grad student to a brilliant professor just a bit older and so attractive that not even the idea of possibility ever entered the picture.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“K? Can I ask you something and not make you mad?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, yeah, of course, you know me, when have I ever bit anyones head off?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“True. Um, that would be me normally and that is my concern. But tonight…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah, you know you are like very out of place in IT not to mention a datacenter.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

K was always ridiculing him but always with a good natured smile that he’d take it and wait for more. It felt like it meant she cared.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know. Still working that out. But now, don’t avoid my question.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You have yet to ask it”, K smiled.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Its nothing just you seem a little sad tonight, just a little quieter, a little more pissed off, like a little something you’re holding in”, he reached and pointed to her heart.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sad? You think I am sad. Here I am frustrated and almost swearing at you and so where does that come from?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mark then almost regretted having started this.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You are not acting like you. If I did not know you better, well, I would let it go. But all these hours we’ve spent together, never seen you like this. If it were me - because it is often - I would be covering up that I am sad.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What the hell. You think everyone is just like you? I have news for you.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Then what is it? I mean you can just go on being as you have been tonight but I am trying to offer you an alternative.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Mark, where the fuck are you going with this?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Where were these words coming from? He was much more of a nutcase and emotionally reactive than anyone he knew. And would chase the tail of his own mind way more often than is happy or sane.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But it was only a second and Karina - Karina the woman, not K the uber geek - held her laser gaze at him.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Ok, fine. She left me yesterday, my girlfriend of two years... we broke up. I guess that tells you a little more about me than you knew already. You happy?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I had guessed and wondered about your life, was curious, but more really about who would be so lucky to be yours.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Still holding her solid gaze and clearly trying to keep things under control, he could see a slight softening in her eyes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

K was not used to anyone getting to her and for some reason she felt a kind warmth towards Mark. With the softening, a tear fell from the corner of her right eye, which clearly was the tip of the iceberg of the flood of water pooling in her luminescent marbled eyes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mark quickly realized this whole inquiry might not have been the right thing to say.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Particularly I can’t afford to piss her off an lose her professional help._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I mean, I am sorry, what I just said. I know didn’t help.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No.”, Karina stated emphatically in a whisper, partly to keep the conversation private from the ever-present ears in the DC, part to keep from crying more, “what you just said, I felt it in my heart and I tell you, if you were a woman you would probably have jumped up on the list of rebound candidates,” her tears floating over to laughter briefly before returning but now in a silent flood.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Come on, lets get a breath of air?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

K tapped Marks hand lightly, conscious that everything, literally everything that happened in the DC was captured by video and kept for time immemorial. Probably audio too.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Lets make sure candid camera here, these guys don’t get any ideas about me... unlike you I have a reputation to uphold!”, she joked through her apparent distress. As they made it through the front door, after clearing several biometric fingerprint scanners intended to both keep people in and out of the DC, she spoke.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“This is just things of life, its all going to be ok.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah well, yes, true, and nicely rationalized. I'd expect nothing less from you. But in here you still hurt nevertheless”, Mark tapping on her upper right shoulder, “and if you want to talk or just cry it out, I am here and its like 3:37am and we’re hostages of goddamn Microsoft for the unforeseen future. So take advantage of it, if you like. Or punch me, whatever,” he smiled.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Karina smiled, and then just reached for Mark, making a very weak attempt at a jab. Then reaching up with her right arm first and then her left, slowly and reluctantly, arms hanging around his neck gently, she fell into him. And for a few minutes let the tears interspersed with words flow. It was nothing new under the sun any of the things she said. But for Mark to feel how much this woman, such a strong and powerful woman felt and cared about things, really, to be so close and on this side for someone - anyone - was a first.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I wonder if this is what its like to be a woman and have close friends_?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Or heck to have a man friend who could let it down and out. He, true, had had a few close woman friends. And never someone letting herself go like this. It felt so good. It felt like being in love only that the love was just for absorbing the pain of his friend, and the honor of being permitted into her deepest authenticity, it literally made him feel a glow. Not to mention the woman who was sharing with him would do circles around him in everything related to anything in his serendipitously chosen line of work and probably most other things in life.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not to mention she wears black and rides a Ducati.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Lets go back in, okay?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

K, apparently refreshed and slightly embarrassed to have let go and for so long, looked up now with a sly smile.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I dont know what made you think you could come in here and be like this with me.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She paused for several seconds, then looking more directly and with a tone of gratitude into his eyes,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But thank you”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Long pause, looking down to the right,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Because no one really does that for me, I guess they think I'm just so fucking strong and invincible and that I don’t need it... but now you know the truth that I am not.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She trailed off, staring off into space, “Are you disillusioned as well?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Hey, you,”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mark gestured to catch her attention, “You are strong as anything, woman, but you have a heart and you feel. Jesus Christ, you’re alive. Thats all. I dunno, maybe too, everyone is afraid to get past that wall.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He smiled, “Shit, I was petrified at the words coming from my mouth.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Thank you Mark,” she completed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He knew she was done. They returned to find the update complete and pretty soon after they were both able to head home. There was no more talk on the subject. Then or for the rest of what would be a few more months working together. He remembered too how he had gone home and told April the next day about K and how she had opened up to him. April had lovingly told him too that he inspired peoples trust.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Back in the dark room, in the present, tears started to $er eyes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Damn it! $he had not expected this memory. $he was so sorry and hurt about all that had happened with April.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But I’m still at a complete loss to have done anything differently._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even if plopped back in the same place and time with her back then, $he still did not have an answer or a different path. Hence $er need for some help off this fence and reaching out for K.
