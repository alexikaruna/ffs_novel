<!-- wp:paragraph -->

To...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Who has always been here but for acceptance, a name and outward appearance.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Who never gives up searching, often on the tail of a feeling and a distant hope.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Deciding to trust oneself, body and feelings, even when the external world has come up empty on answers.
