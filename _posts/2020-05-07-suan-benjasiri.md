<p>Its name was Suan Benjasiri. One stop on the Skytrain from Cat’s clinic. Suan meant ‘park’ in Thai, the formal word being something like ‘suansaturna’. It was an easy word for Mali to remember and so perfect, conjuring an image of swans and Saturn, like a big orb with swans going all around it. A perfect word for the most treasured of places in $er day to day life. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>‘Suan’ to Mali also sounded a bit like ‘suay’ which meant beautiful in Thai. And today as always, Cat was ‘suay mak mak’, very very beautiful. It did feel weird to think this ‘as a man’. It felt like it put an artificial distance between them. Even a little creepy. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As they sat on the bench by the lake, Cat put her fingers on the stubble Mali had let grow, feigning to pull at it, with a curious and playful smile.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“What <em>is</em> this??!” &nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Mali had let go upon returning home after that visit with Cat. It was not a conscious decision. It was strange but like times in the past when $he’d had been taunted or even mildly threatened because of $er appearance. It was a pattern $he had started to see - that within a week $he’d have an urge to call off the dressing, makeup and be a guy again. But the change if she'd be conscious of it, was not from fear of it recurring as it was more out of despair of her impossible situation.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this case too, $he had missed the trigger which would have been to own the despair in Cat’s disappearance. And all the confusion between the two exacerbated by that virtually perfect day together.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But in absence of this awareness, the prescription on this twilight level was to become who $he ‘needed to be’ for Cat… for the world, <em>for survival</em>. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>A man.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All $he had really felt in this few week interim was more of frustration and anger. And to $er that was ‘guy mode’. Those were the ‘guy’ emotions $he knew, the only ones $he knew as a man.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Hence the stubble and eating a bit more, which counter-intuitively actually made $er body feel more feminine and look sexier in the mirror, because doing so also increased $er energy and drive for exercise and romance, libido too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The jeans and button-down shirt HE wore today could be ‘either’ but with such a slender and graceful physique, more female than male. The gay guys were all over it checking HIM out today. Regardless of how insecure $he was in $er femininity, HE was completely lost in terms of masculinity, even more now, back in the big city with all eyes on HIM it felt. HE didn’t even know how to move when HE walked. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>HE hated the male attention. Every possible wrong signal.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Mali finally answered, “I don’t know. I just let it be.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>God did this feel wrong. HE felt miles away from the woman sitting next to HIM.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“But all the laser?”&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Something in Cat made her question what was going on. It was just a stubble, but they had talked too much, shared too much. She knew too much about Mali to believe it wasn’t deeper.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>What had happened in these three weeks?</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Mali shrugged. There was really no good answer anymore. Or that $he was willing to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Just let me be.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>$he wanted to cry, this all felt so bad. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The truth is the deepest part inside wanted Cat and would do anything for her.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Even this.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Just being with Cat had always felt like coming home, out of the rain. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And if there was one thing Mali wanted - no, needed - in life, it was to come home and out of the rain. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To be together. With HER.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This gender thing was simply a fucked-up thorn in the side of what mattered most.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Being with Cat, out with Cat, in relationship with Cat would validate HIS life. Show the gay onlookers that HE had other business here. And fill $er heart.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<!-- /wp:separator --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They continued to sit, shaded on their bench not by trees but by the rather massive high rise buildings at the northwest side of the park. To Mali it was one of the most civilized parks in the city. All kinds of people practicing tai chi and qi gong, the exercise crowd, the lawn sprawlers, and then the sitting couples, including them, on the abundant benches.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Usually HE - well, not HE, $he, would be the additional rogue: the hula hoop dancer. But not today. As a HE, Mali would just be relegated to eating HIS heart out in the expression of other women’s femininity. As well when passing the lingerie store.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Just pretend not to look, not to feel, not to care.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Hoop-dancing was one of the doors $he had found to open to $er deepest feminine. And the only way to the most surrendered dance was to be more of that. Because even to date, there was so much more poise and grace to obtain. There were not a lot of things $he knew in life, but in terms of the evolution of $er body, the hoop was the teacher. There was one true path.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“I’m sorry I did not call you,” Cat broke in to Mali’s rumination and the mostly predominant silence that had lingered over them since leaving her clinic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Part of that silence was her own. She had also been completely blown out by their day together. Not either being able to completely recognize or admit that over the past months that Mali had taken over the void left in her life by the absence of  Koona. And what that meant - about her, about her and Mali, the professed katoey, much less, her apparently dead friendship with Koona. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Something hurt somewhere deep inside, but she could not get there.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“No, I realize I just as much should have reached out. You - and your family - showed me such a nice… amazing… time - I barely thanked you.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All of the sudden Mali felt more sad. Fuck it was hard being a guy. In the moment HE realized that HE was supposed to have been the one to take initiative, and how this must look now ---
weak.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m sorry,” addeded Mali, “I hope I didn’t tarnish the day we had, it was fantastic. In fact more than that. I’ve just had a lot going on.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Going on?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, yeah. I… I don’t know how much to say,” then making an about turn, “It was just such a busy few weeks. I have been sorting out a lot of things, work, what I am doing here, all that.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Why?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not buying this, Mali._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Because, it feels like I am on borrowed time. Well, life is borrowed time, you know?” HE said, tears forming in $er eyes, “All we have is what is now and I just, well, I want to know I’m not making horrible mistakes.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If there was one thing, however much Mali intended a poker face, $he loved intimacy and disclosure too much to withhold with someone $he was connecting with in the present.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“How could someone like you make a horrible mistake? I have hard time believing it.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled, loving Cat’s English with only slight and far in between errors that showed only the careful listener that she wasn’t a native speaker.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Its just hard when I’m not working and don’t have income. I feel bad about myself. My self-esteem. Even if I don’t need it immediately, still.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Work?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat’s bullshit detector was redlining. But if it was true what Mali was saying, then it saddened her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, what I’ve done in the past and want to do in the future. They are not the same and I’ve been sitting on this fence for gosh, now, maybe seven years. Its too much!”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Part truth, the easy part._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The couple stared at the water and the floating and maneuvering ducks and swans. None of this was right, Mali admitted to HIMSELF. $he had a lump in HIS throat. HE felt like a fraud, a lie. A black hole. The same black hole that would be in HIS relationship with Cat or any future relationship if HE ignored who $he had become the last few years. Too many things, tremendous growth, and most of it feminine in nature.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The grace of the swans and the peace of the early evening tugged at the smokescreen. The company of this dear special soul with HIM. How could $he waste these moments, should they never come again?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat also felt heaviness but did not know how to maneuver it. Something was off. Had to be broken. No matter what illusion or bubble was around them, the same bubble that probably held both of them in limbo from eachother the last few weeks.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even though she wished the relationship between them would not change, for Mali to really be the Mali she thought she knew - the artistic, sweet, soft rockstar. Like he seemed to be trying to do...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Was it for me? All this?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But it had to give. The energy wasn’t right.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She also knew deep inside that _this_ Mali would never have even made it to their first outing together. Because _that_ Mali was different. _That_ was the Mali she felt free with, not _this one_.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How could it be?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This Mali was all she’d ever wanted on paper. But in the end not.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After a few more minutes of staring, appreciating and deliberating, Cat spoke in a soft, breathy, huskier tone.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, look at me.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was the most feminine and commanding. Irresistible to _that part_ deep inside HE was veiling to the world tonight.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cats head was turned toward him and he slowly let the rigidity in HIS neck and chest allow it to turn.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Look at me,” she repeated as if anything but full contact was not enough.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And $he did.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Maybe the problem is another fence you’re sitting on,” Cat looked intently and directly into Mali’s eyes, “Can I speak frankly?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali caught off-guard nodded, coddling the lump in HIS throat, afraid to speak. HE felt about to be devoured by a tiger.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, you don’t have to be anything you’re not with me, okay?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded but averting HIS eyes.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, look at me, okay?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali shook HIS head, “I can’t Cat. You’ll hate me if I tell you everything.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat sighed and let out a long breath.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, this is not who you are. What’s the point of this? We both know this feels horrible right now. And we both know too that we’ve never been like this before together,” pausing, “And from my perspective, there’s only one difference.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay.” Mali waited for more.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat sat and waited too. She knew to.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay,” Mali swallowed.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Time to come to Jesus.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I just… after our day together. I felt sad you were not still with me. Something in me wants… I feel like you are like bathed in light. I just wanted to be closer to you,” the tears coming to $er eyes, “Out of this darkness, the cloud I live under day to day…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat arched her eyebrows.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali felt a surge of anger, “I just try so hard and never get there… You want a man. I was trying. Shit, it’s so embarrassing to say this.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What kind of shell of a person am I? Ditching the true me by the side of the road in order to love and be loved?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali lost it and tears flowed. Sobs. All this longing. For and within. Seemingly at odds. The wound HE’d been trying to heal over broke open once again. A loosening of all that armor $he did not even realize had been re-accumulating around $er heart and neck over the last few weeks.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It didn’t matter, $he couldn’t deceive Cat. There was no point.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he let go and looked at Cat, her poised yet strongly loving presence. Cat had turned toward $er and had her arm up on the top of the bench, even in this moment not lost on Mali her slender figure with gentle curves, this most beautiful face, full cheeks and eyes that were now looking directly back, also clearly tearing up as well.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he was back where $he was a few weeks before. But more solidly. Just like every time $he's tried to be a guy.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It always ends with tears and ‘coming to Jesus’._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

At that moment a sheet of rain fell.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not surprising either as they both realized they had felt but ignored the cooling and a gentle but persistent breeze since the time they had sat down.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It down-poured with no foreplay at all, like someone had overturned a bucket.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They quickly broke from the bench.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The gazebo!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was ahead of $er and gestured for Mali to follow, “Come on!”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was no chance of not being drenched, only the hope of not being so continuously!&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Once safely under the structure which jutted out a little bit into the lake, leaning back against a railing, Mali who had now lost all inhibition, feeling everything, surrendered to the sadness, crying.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he couldn’t speak at all but gestured for Cat to come to $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat came over and Mali looked at her directly, into that poised, and now wet beautiful face with running mascara. As beautiful wet and disheveled as in her finest, $he thought. $he latched on to Cat’s lower arms near the elbows as she came close, and somehow as if she knew to complete the circuit, let $er hands fall to Cats. Looking into Cats eyes, continuing to cry, Mali fought for the words…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cat, all I have ever wanted is this. Fuck,” inside Mali all the pain and torture of a life feeling taunted by this burning ember of desire for such closeness and always seemingly elusive. As was now. It was just unacceptable.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat cocked her head to the side in question. Mali continued but cryptically, “I am not a man. I hate being a man. To be myself is to not be a man. But to have this with you… I am supposed to be a man.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Cat this is my fucking life!” the tears and the coordinating muscles in full flow, “Its cuts both ways but both ways are inside myself. I can be me or I can be with ‘her’. And each way cuts into a different side of my heart. I can’t win here. In this place. Goddammit. I can’t!” then from the depth $he felt a rage, a rage like being taunted by god. Put in an impossible double-bind.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Fuck God!” Mali yelled. Not for the first time in $er life and for the same reason $he yelled it the first time when not even understanding the problem, years ago, in bed with $er last ex.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although it would have been above many, Cat caught the message. And she also knew this was no time to prolong a conversation. So also did what was her instinct but certainly not what her culture and training would say is acceptable. She came closer and embraced Mali with all her heart. Hoping, in some way inside, she could flood away this pain he - she - was buried in. This confusion. It did not make sense to her completely but the spirit of Mali’s words did. She held and let Mali hold her back and continue until complete. Which Mali did.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Strangely, a feeling - no, an image - of a smiling Koona swept across her like one of those fluffy white clouds at the pool, that fateful last moment after all those years as friends, all gone. She felt like crying now too.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe it was contagious._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In a few minutes of holding in silence, things soon quieted down in both of them and the rain.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, can I take you somewhere?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali loosened $er grip and getting Cat’s eyes back into visibility, all $he could do was nod.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he didn't even care to ask where. As it really didn’t matter if it meant being together. $er heart warmed that Cat wanted still to be with $er after this insanity. Still with anxiety of jeopardy as never had anything like this ever happened to $er or turned out happily.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They were both still dripping. Although neither could be sure what was rain and what were tears anymore.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Do you mind walking? Even a lot? Maybe thirty minutes?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I love to walk,” Mali smirked, the only expression possible moving between tears and smile.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Nodding, Cat began to impulse them to movement out of the embrace and on the way.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Out of the park, onto the street.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Down a block and a turn.
