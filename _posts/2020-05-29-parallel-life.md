Omaha, Nebraska

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sometime near the present.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The group sat on the steps of the Crossroads Mall, 72nd and Dodge, just west of midtown Omaha. It was a clear, slightly cool late afternoon. Just normal, down-to-earth real Midwest girls, although facts being, any one of them would fit in just fine in New York or London. And each on their own would have made it in such cities. They were the _different one’s,_ outcasts and rebels in their own way. But the smaller city kept them close in ways that maybe would not have happened elsewhere.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They were all busy and had gone their own ways in the paths of their lives but they made time at least once a month to all be together and do what they knew -- to make mischief. At the moment the only thing seemingly in common besides their friendship was that they had all miraculously become single within the period of a couple months. As if it was contagious. Neither one complained. They each wanted out for their own reasons.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sitting up on the higher step to the left was Anastasia. Slender, with a slightly long angular face but a curved, upturned nose and wide, expressive big blue eyes. The poised dancer of the little group, she loved jumping around gracefully and playing with movement. Everyone had thought it all was something she would grow out of, but now having passed 40, not a chance. As a young girl they tried to have her channel it. Ballet class... well... was a disaster in her youth and she had been extracted, the actual event was one which was never discussed publicly but only in the quiet intimacy among the dance teachers of Omaha and surrounding areas for time to come and _not_ something Ana ever would talk about herself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To anyone.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She was smiling, laughing and lightly waving her hand at her friend -- an apparently tall, even while seated dirty blond -- ‘get out of here’ as the apparent cause of the hilarity. That was Jessi and she was just the clown, driving them to tears, always. And Natalia, wide smile over to the right, as if biting her tongue. The quiet one, shy with a few years on the other two, but always on call to join the fun. From early on age meant nothing to any of them.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They had been friends most of their lives, seemed only yesterday Jessi on the nursery school playground was still working out the pronunciation saying ‘Anaia’ like a sing-song, meaning Anastasia, a very difficult name. They were like twins only from different parents, and they lived next door to each other. Always inciting the intrigue, Anastasia could never resist. The irresistible love of laughter and the smile brought them together and whatever they could do to bring it on, it would be done. But they were kind too and never mean. They just liked to have fun and it wasn’t fun to see someone hurt or cry.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So that day when the two came on a crying Natalia, their hearts bled. Natalia was _big_. She looked to them like an adult, she was in fifth grade, they had seen her! But now she was sitting by the big oak tree with her head down looking at her knees as the tears fell. The other two approached at a distance and stood there. They both were a little afraid, even the apparently fearless Jessi.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Still was a big girl even if she was crying.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Was this okay?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Jessica, the clown, put on a big stupid smile and stood there waiting for her audience to look up. Ana stood there watching Jessica and the crying girl wondering what to do. Then Ana had an idea. She walked over and sat down next to her, her back also against the tree, looking over, with kind big brown eyes just said, “are you okay?”.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The crying girl turned and looked at her, tears running down her cheek and sniffled with her nose, “They are so mean to me. I am just new here. Why do they hate me, they don’t even know me?”, she sobbed, “They pushed me and spilled my books and didn’t let me pick them up. So I came to the tree.”, she continued, the words ‘the tree’ as if it had a special meaning.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Where did you come from?”, asked an approaching Jessica, still with some remnant of a smile.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Natalia looked at her for a second, as if maybe there was danger and if it was okay. She turned to Ana to check, “This is Jessica. She’s a bit crazy, but she’s my friend, it’s okay.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then as if on prompt, Jessi broke in, “Well, this is Ana - and she likes Tigger, you know, the tiger?” Natalia nodded quietly as Jessi continued, "she’s also crazy.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Natalia smirked at the two, “Like Tigger? Really?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Jessica sat down in front of them and looked at the new girl. When she did, Natalia smiled, “I always wanted to meet Tigger. I thought Tigger was a boy though?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Tigger is whoever they want to be!” smiled Ana. Which solidified the deal and brought a real smile to Natalia.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m Natalia,” she said, “My parents, we moved here a few weeks ago. We always move. I hate it. I have no friends.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well you have two now!” blurted Jessica. Ana nodded.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So they took your books?!” asked Jessica, adding, “Who?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Over there, those boys.” They could all see the little group of about five boys and there were in fact some books scattered on the ground. Third graders. &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’ll get them for you,” Jessica turned serious. Kids in her own class.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Over time, it would become known to never mess with Jessi. An unwritten rule that had yet to be unwritten.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Walking the length of the school yard, she approached the boys, “Did you take away Natalia’s books?”, she questioned. They looked at her, and one scruffy face boy piped up, “Who’s Natalie?”, pausing, “and what if we did? Then what?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It's not Natalie. It's Natalia,” corrected Jessica, pausing, staring at him, buying a few moments, “and those are her books!”, she pointed to the scattering, a few with bindings spread open, face down, a couple others flat. “She’s my friend and you don’t do that to my friend!” Jessica filled with indignant emotion, which was like the combined feeling of being able to run fast - faster than all the boys even a few grades up - and that of falling off the edge on a roller coaster.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She bent down to pick up the books, as the boy, asserting apparent dominion over the mess began the motion to kick her away with his right leg, more like a shoo than a kick, “get away, we can do what we want. Go over there with the other girls,” he pointed at the far side of the yard with a group playing hop scotch.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Jessica saw the leg coming and also saw red. Like in slow motion, and instead of accepting sure impact, however light, she sprung into her legs and at the same time grabbed the approaching foot, standing up. The boy fell over on his butt like he had been knocked over with a feather. The rest of the group chortled at the fate of their leader.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I said,” she continued, “you don’t do that to my friend. Got it?”, as she put her little black closed sandaled foot onto his chest like she’d seen in the movies. The boy said nothing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So her legacy began. Jessi. Sweetheart. Protector.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Without opposition, she picked up the books and started to walk away, turning her head to watch her back. Some things are innate. Wherever she got her talents, it was not learned, it was a gift. One which would be tested, often not to her choosing, repeatedly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And so was the glue that bound the little triad, on that fateful day. And set up Jessi for a learning moment that influenced her up to this day.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As she approached Anastasia and Natalia, she smiled holding up the books like a trophy, depositing them at Natalia’s side. Natalia looked up with big brown eyes of thanks, smiling.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What’s she doing?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Jessi looked over at what Natalia meant. Ana was standing over on the playground stage with her arms and chest open, head tilted slightly back.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh...” Jessi thought about how to explain this, “You best just watch what comes next…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Its time for dance time!” announced Anastasia, sprouting up to her tall poise, “hey, there are hoops, lets get them!” as she ran over toward the building as if others were in a race and they were at risk of missing out. Grabbing the hula-hoops as the other girls approached, she handed-threw each one as she ran past back to the shade of the tree. “Now look at this! I’m Michael Jackson!!!”, as she put the hoop up at her waist and proceeded to do successive twirl-pirouettes gracefully moving across into the tanbark with a moonwalk, stirring up a cloud of dust. She was smiling fiercely and completely alive. Anyone could see, this girl was nothing normal, not in motion.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The other two joined, Jessica as a background dancer and Natalia shyly alternating holding the hoop like she was looking through it as if what was going on in front was a TV show, and shyly twirling it above her head.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Natalia’s family never moved again. Jessi was challenged but never defeated - in smile or in physical prowess. And Anastasia became, well stayed herself, generally known as Ana. Tucked away in time, in Omaha, waiting to be discovered.
