_I even told those fudge-packers I liked Michael Bolton's music._  
— Character ‘Michael Bolton’ in Office Space

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali wore tight jeans and one of $er signature black andro tanks. Combat boots and the usual makeup and jewelry except that both were taken up a notch. All silver jewelry, thicker edgy rings in $er ears and even a larger nose stud. $he didn’t know quite why $he did this or the real cause of the mood $he was in other than it felt like aggression.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The lovechild of longing and frustration.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A 'fuck-you too' I don’t give a shit anymore attitude._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Yet $he felt feminine - $erself - tonight. That was the thing, for $er andro clothes were fem. Having begun back on the light dose of estrogen and anti-androgen on whim $he’d picked up at the pharmacy upon returning to Bangkok, they seemed to be helping.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It wasn’t a bad mood, if anything was a devil-may-care one that got $er to do things, take action and risks. The same which also got $er through the ‘fuck you’ phase of not caring about outcomes, as $he’d learned through life experience that anticipating disappointment was important to $er emotional survival.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But it was not without a pang of sadness as $he was ironically led to the same table as last time. Cat was not there yet. And the realization that $he missed Cat’s friendship, even more now after the long four days of solitude. With all the disharmony within, $he desperately needed someone to talk to.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Could that person be Cat? But…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Nice table”, Cat smirked as $he was shown in.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What was not so good was that…&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All the feelings $he’d distanced from were here now, back in the present.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he shook her head internally…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That fucking night._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Cat seated herself, gracefully as ever, but she was different. Well, she was in jeans and sandals. She just seemed looser, not so tightly wound. Less Japanese-like and if Mali had her druthers, just a tinge more counter-culture Thai. Not like the flimsy ultra-feminine women that were the staple there with their helpless end emotional airs. Not that Cat was ever this as… simply just polished.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Always with substance, unlike so many of the ultra-fems._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She was still polished but there was a little grit and some sand in it. Mali liked the change.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe it meant that…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat too noticed Mali back in the middle-of-the-road rockstar mode and up a notch. And so typical of Mali, not trying to be feminine actually for some reason came across that way so much more, in stark contrast to the gay-ish outfit of their last meeting here which helped no one.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_That was interesting too._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Especially given what she needed to say.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat put her elbows on the table and looked into Mali’s eyes moving the mood immediately to the business of what seemed like utmost urgency.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It came out like a confession… No dinner, no small talk. Just the truth.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, I’ve not been a very nice person, I know I’ve hurt you and I owe you an apology.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She stopped, sat back, and looked down, shaking her head.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I don’t know where to start”.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

How should she tell Mali about Koona? She had barely ever mentioned her to $er. She’d not thought this out, words usually were not an issue for her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Wherever you want. You have as much time as you like, I’ve no plans”, Mali smiled. Regardless $he liked that it felt like Cat was veering back to the authentic openness they had always had before _that night_. But too, $he still was upset inside.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sure. Well…”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So Cat proceeded to tell Mali about her youth in Japan, about Koona, the vacation, the last moment by the pool, their friendship, the year of lost contact and just up to the night Mali stayed over. But not about the last week and the re-encounter. She suspected that would be simply cruel.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, this is the hard part, and it’s something I don’t understand, but it’s something I want to tell you. You might hate me forever, but I’ll be at peace because it’s the truth. And like it or not you helped me get here…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he took a breath. This was probably going to sting.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, you showed me I am - I was - a repressed lesbian.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Jesus._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Of all possibly worlds Mali had imagined for tonight, this was not one of them…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Did this mean that…? And now…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know this now, and without that night together I might have taken a lot longer to realize this”.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali was connecting the dots but needed everything explicitly laid out now.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But what was it? Why?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although still in shock, $er emotional eagerness for even the breadcrumbs of something positive for $erself, $he secretly hoped it would be that $er softness and being had been seen and recognized.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, the only thing I can say is that you, the way you are, how soft, how you were with me, that we could just be together, feel, explore and let go, somehow…”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat paused because here was the hurtful part.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It’s just that something happened in me. It started in the afternoon and then when we were together more. But I kept seeing Koona. Okay, I mean even before sometime when we were together I’d all of the sudden think of her. I didn’t understand it and why. Now I do. I think you brought it up in me… let me feel more free than I’ve ever let myself…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat paused, taking a drink of water and a breath from her run-on sentence.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You got in because I wanted you to be a guy. A guy with such a way of being. I feel cruel but I didn’t do it on purpose…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“The thing is, when… when we went over the edge, you know”, she winked, “I realized I’m in love with her. And have been for a very long time. Long before you and I met.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat paused and added for emphasis, “In that moment I knew who I am, how I feel, how I want to love… and that it's okay for me to be this way.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The other foot had dropped. Mali knew the whole thing now and breathed. Cat was silent.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Okay, this was not everything $he’d hoped for but…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m not sure how I should take this. I mean, I thought we we’re getting close. Even as friends. Was anything real? With us?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That’s what hurt. It was not just a hookup. There was so much between them. But then at the same time… what Cat was saying, it also felt validating. To know Cat liked women, at least a woman, felt like it went along with how $he felt inside. And after the last few days $he needed this validation badly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know. I have to take responsibility that my confusion has caused this.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali looked at Cat who now had inclined her head to her lap.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So you’re not into me regardless of what gender I am then?” Mali smirked.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Fact was even in this moment Mali was still conscious that the entire friendship and relationship with Cat had been a gift, something that came to a confused in-between person who had…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Still…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not worked $erself out._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Nevertheless, $he was a human being, with feelings.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or so one would think._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So now you’ve rejected me both as a woman and a man. I’m not sure how I should take that,” Mali smirked again. If nothing $er sarcastic sense of humor was never too far, especially in disappointment and defeat. Cat raised her eyes and caught it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Mali, if Koona were not in the picture, this might be another conversation. Do you realize that? Do you realize what I’m saying? Forget about me, think of what this means for you.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Koona wasn’t in the fucking picture a minute ago! She barely ever mentioned her._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

"Looks like a shit sandwich from where I'm sitting..." Mali couldn't help it, “It would just be someone else. What woman is going to want me as a woman looking as I do?,” Mali paused, "You know damn well you could have anyone you wanted. You would choose someone else."

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They sat in silence. Mali was just shaking $er head internally.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know it sounds awful, and very Buddhist, but maybe you ought to trust life to show you?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Like us. You trusted life… me… and something happened. You learned more about you, right? You think too much. I mean, that’s good, that’s what makes you different. But maybe you just need to feel. Accept and move forward?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was like the theme of $er life. But somehow it made sense still.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_It also makes sense to get the fuck out of here.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Now._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The emotion and anger was starting to boil in Mali. It did make sense to get out of here. How could we ever have a friendship at this point?&nbsp;How could I ever have any face in front of her? And have to see her with Koona?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And maybe it didn't turn out as you’d want but…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I think I should go now. I wish you the best, I really do,” as the tears welled, because the connection $he felt to Cat was still there, but $he was far too pissed to care, $he still carried all of the last four days not to mention years, “I need to turn the page. I understand what you’ve told me. But this is ridiculous. What the fuck do you want from me anyway?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded as Mali got up and turned away thankfully before the tears really started. The sobs at least did not come until $he reached the street. It wasn’t sad crying per se, but being ripped apart.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Realization crying.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The kind of crying that happens when you’ve lived a lie and lost your bet.
