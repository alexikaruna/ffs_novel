The two emerged from the Chatuchak Park subway station and were hit by the usual wall of muggy warmth of the early evening. Thailand heat could be a menace during the day but one of the prizes for holding out were the evenings. The big red sun was setting to the west, its rays masked and scattered by the proliferation of trees, spreading its tinge through spiky shadows over the oblong lake around which the park of many acres was situated. Green grass, Asian styled bridges over small waterways. A refuge from an urban jungle which at times reminded Mali of New York City, at others, Latin America.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But this park, only could be in Thailand. Not to mention this moment.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smiled at Mali with a little shiver, overcoming the air conditioning freeze of the subway. It felt good to be here and with Mali. There was something natural and transparent about... actually kind of Asian about him… &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Unusual._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although she loved her culture, revered her parents and had a close group of friends, it all sometimes felt like a cage with eggshells on the floor, having to be careful where she stepped. And the thing she couldn’t fully understand was that her culture was quite permissive of individual liberty, in its own way. So she was aware on some sort of twilight level of something being off. But she could never say exactly where or what. She was in theory free to be whatever and whoever she wanted. More or less. Just something missing. But something important too. Something juicy.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So you like to come here often?” she asked.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah, in fact I live not far, and I walk here in the morning, very early for my practice.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Practice?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali explained $er ‘standing still’ practice to Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That’s a long time. I like that. I bet it’s wonderful, the stillness…” Cat looked over at Mali, processing what it must be like to be still for almost an hour each day, and what would motivate someone to do that. With her head tilted she prompted for more.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Cat is truly unbelievable._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It just comes from inside, it helps me connect to and remember who I am. Somehow it seems when I do this I feel much more alive, passionate — juicy.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The word juicy not being lost on Cat, “You _are_ different,” she exclaimed, making Mali’s heart miss a beat, of course still reading too deeply as always into everything.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So tell me more about you?” Mali was finally learning to not talk about $erself all the time. It felt good actually.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Like what?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Anything. Whats on your mind?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat knew this was her cue. She barely knew Mali but she trusted him… &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay, well you know I did think maybe you could help me with something. It’s sometimes hard to talk to anyone here. I mean, if I talk within whats accepted it’s fine, but to talk outside of it, you get blank stares and deer in headlights look.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled widely as if to laugh, recognizing how ridiculous and unusual was Cat’s mastery of English, the beauty that it came through a still moderate Thai-asian accent. Especially in Thailand where at best foreign languages tended to be spoken on Thai-language terms generally.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Must be something big, huh? Well spill it!”, Mali raised $er chin and brows. $he was starting to feel just a bit more comfortable here with her.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay, well lets see where I start. I am - have always been - a very independent person. I do what I want. Like returning to Japan and living there recently, aside from the other countries I have visited and languages I know. That’s almost unheard of here,” Cat rolled her head up with her eyes for emphasis, “I mean, doing so on my own, my own money and means, not my family’s or a husbands,” Cat arched her brows as if to send a question mark to make sure Mali understood what she was saying, “So I guess I have a certain ability to be outside the box… or to want to be.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That’s cool… I like that. There’s nothing wrong with that, right?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“The thing. I have had a boyfriend. Thai boyfriend but we’re separated. Everyone, including him, wants us to be married. On paper it is perfect too. He does well in his business - well it’s a family business and he inherited it - but he’s a smart person but is definitely Thai and not a hybrid like I tend to think of myself.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Are you truly a hybrid? Are you parents both Thai?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali couldn’t either imagine Cat being fully Thai nor not being so.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It’s a funny thing, yes. But somehow, I’ve always felt different. Especially since I lived in Japan when I was young. My parents sent me the first time, my once poor family had come into some money and they thought it would be good for me to go to school there. And it was.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I can see that, you remind me of Japanese style and culture. You also seem very awake and aware. I guess in Buddhism, you’ve been around the block a few times,” Mali chuckled, “Well, at least you put on a good show of it.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat joined in the smile. “Yeah, I feel that way. I feel like I see beyond many things and can’t let go of being that way. But then too there are many things traditional that I do like. Beyond love, I fear nothing. I just fear when I’m confused.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat looked out over the lake at the apex of the ornamented white bridge they were crossing, then walking to the rail, stopped.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“About love. You’re confused?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat was not exactly a person $he’d imagine being confused about anything. That way she held herself. Mali as well could hardly come to grips that $he was here having a pretty deep conversation with the same spokesmodel-like Cat from the clinic. She was the best of all worlds - so cultured yet at the same time showing to be a person who could open up.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_To me no less._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali decided in that moment Cat was simply not of a single nation or culture. She was the future.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah,” Cat inhaled deeply as if preparing, “So, basically, I didn’t want to marry so I made that clear. I am not going to be some man’s possession. Not even for a good man,” she turned to wink at Mali, “That’s exactly what I would be walking into here.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Why?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“The culture here makes us property and men can do as they wish more or less, have mistresses, be unfaithful, and the worst, simply not be my best friend.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat tugged lightly on Mali’s arm to prompt them on their way to the other side of the bridge.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What I’ve always wanted is something much more than what I see. I’ve never had it. The only reason I believe in it is because I feel it. Once in a while I know of someone or hear stories of such loves. But its really just in here,” Cat tapped gently on her heart and upper breast.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know what you mean.” Mali knew exactly. As if Cat was a mirror image. And it made $er feel conflicted and sad.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Because she could be the perfect other half._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You do?” Cat broke Mali from the rumination that was beginning.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Actually yeah. A few years ago my heart broke when I started seeing the real dynamic between men and women. I was like ‘What the fuck! I didn’t sign up for this!’” Mali recoiled a bit at $er own swearing. But Cat seemed non-plussed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So $he continued “I always wanted intimacy, to be equals. Also, it’s kind of like… I didn’t realize it for so long, that it was unnatural to be in the man’s role for me,” and now was the time to disclose that sadness, “But then I still long for a partner, a woman. And I wonder if I’m all screwed up. I’m not what they want,” $he paused, deciding not to go on, “That’s what hurts.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah,” Cat looked off into the distance and spoke dreamily, “that’s funny you say it that way.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They edged off the main pavement onto a winding and rustic path laid with stone that cut through a more secluded grassy area.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Why’s that?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, I had never really put it in those words. But I prefer just to be with my friends, I don’t really feel like I’m missing anything,” once again her vision drifting and her mind apparently far away and then stopping, &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“That of course sat really well with my boyfriend when I told him!” Cat laughed a bit huskily, “But it’s true. I feel free with my friends. With a boyfriend I feel in a kind of role.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She turned things back to Mali, “So then what did you do when you realized how you felt about the reality of men and women?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“In time I made it here,” Mali smiled.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As if on cue there were a few tones that came from the park loudspeakers that had been playing soft music for a bit. Most parks and public places in Thailand had them. On cue, everyone from strollers like Cat and Mali, the jogging and exercise crowd as well as couples and groups sprawled on mats on the abundant grass, came to a stop and stood in place while the Thai national anthem played.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was a peaceful moment of stillness and unity with all others that Mali had come to love. It was not like the in your face heart and bible beating national anthem of the USA. If anything, it was quiet, peaceful and polite. The best of Thailand.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They had now made it over to the far north side of the park, now in the dusk shade, they sat on a bench near the lake, not far from where Mali would come to stand in the mornings.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Why Thailand?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Honestly?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It was to see the katoey. Both in my attraction to them and about my own confusion with myself.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, when I first came here I tried once more to 'be a guy'. Like this twisted thing in my head that made me think I had to present as a guy here. And that lasted about two weeks during which I even started falling for the woman who rented me my apartment,” Mali laughed, “But day after day I felt like I ran into so many gay and katoey - like everywhere - and I saw how feminine and sweet they were. And how okay and beautiful they were with themselves.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he hadn’t thought of this for some time. But it had been kind of the last turning point for $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So I put my makeup and clothes back on and never looked back really.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And the woman?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I let her be.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he couldn’t contemplate pursuing her. As who - what $he was then. Now. So $he continued at the time to simply live as $he had the previous years - to long and hope for but not really believe, certainly not try. Yet, here was the sadness again. And Cat had already stepped miles ahead of that woman. $he tried not to have the thought but it already had come:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_If I could be with Cat - forever - would I give all this up and be a man?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded. She understood yet… it was a lot for her. So she stepped back to her side of the story,

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So I don’t know what to do now. I mean, he’s still seeking me out. My family is in love with him, gosh, for sure more than I have ever have been,” she reflected.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So just let him go, right?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But it’s made me confused too. It’s that I too expected different with men. Kind of what you said. Closer. Transparent. I want this with him but whatever I do doesn’t work. I like the feeling of his strength but it feels not close, intimate as you say. But maybe I should try and work at it, it could become that?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m not sure I’m anyone to consult on matters of successful relationships!” Mali thought of $er own track record throughout $er life.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I cant believe I am telling you all this - do you know what its like in my culture to talk like this, especially to a farang, and someone you just met?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Don’t call me that I hate it! I hate that word!”, Mali said chuckling, “and yeah, I do have an idea and I’m honored. I promise what you tell me is between us and only us.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The combination of this nice tranquil moment in the park, Cat’s beauty, polish, intelligence. And the intimacy of all this self-disclosure. It was the best of everything. $he’d take it over sex or anything else any day. $he really could get used to this.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Like Las Vegas, no? I know of that media campaign!”, broke in Cat, interrupting Mali’s distraction.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“If only you knew,”, $he smiled back.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Its funny, you talk a lot like a woman I dated when living in Mexico some years ago. About men. I was trying to be a man, more masculine, at the time, doing my best, none of these tight jeans, makeup, all that. On the second date we were sitting there having dinner and she mentioned she liked how feminine and soft I was. Horrible! I was at my peak trying to be a guy!”, Mali moved to falsetto and hiding $er face in $er hands in mock shame, “She was like ‘even the most liberal guys here… in the end the machismo just comes out from under the rug’". And then to go on how she had considered being lesbian but in the end could not face the social stigma.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“They are not tolerant there?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“There is more now than ever. Heck, her city, Guadalajara is the ‘gay’ city of Mexico. Anything goes at least in certain areas and circles. So, no, it became clear to me that this was an internal game for her, just as my own is very much about that.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Like here,” Cat murmured, not even knowing what she was saying.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“In Thailand it’s even more tolerant, right? I mean, are you attracted to men? Here its no big deal to be into women, right? Here everyone does what they want - katoey’s, lesbian and gay couples…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I think I’m not into anyone,” Cat cut Mali off, “It’s all too far confusing!” She paused, turning the question on Mali, “So you like women or you were just trying because you thought you had to?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh no, I love women. More than even men do I think. But not how a man wants a woman, it seems. But lately I am not sure who I like or even if I like anyone.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded, “Sad.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Not really, it’s just long and far between to find someone who sparks something in me. You know, I don’t feel attracted often, and really I think hardly anyone finds me attractive anymore either. I feel like I am doing all this, all for myself,” Mali again gesturing to $er appearance, “I often think I’m crazy. But I can’t stop.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So when was the last spark?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali at least knew better than to _speak that truth_ and just shrugged $er shoulders with a grimace.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Years…”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“And what is ‘all this’ that you do?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, women's clothes, makeup, jewelry… hair transplant, starting hormones, thinking of face surgery.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But you don’t wear dresses?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No, I guess maybe I don’t want or need to.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So maybe that’s just how you are, like the rockstars? That’s kind of how I see you. An artist.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Such a description didn’t really bother Mali, in fact it was flattering, if only it was the truth. $he’d seen such men. They were cool. But what was going on inside $er belied a difference.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah. That’s tempting to believe. But I am not sure. I would like to be cuter. I don’t like looking like a man. Those rockstars, eventually they loose hair, go bald, have a belly. But they don’t seem to care.” $he stopped $erself listening to the words that were coming out of $er mouth as they were excruciatingly superficial.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So, it’s that, inside, like in love, let’s just say, that I feel female. My response is feminine. Rockstars still want to be a dude in bed. I’m not like that,” pausing, and then, “Every time I ‘man up’ in life, my sexuality… it’s the first thing that revolts. Then romantically. Then the rest. It happens over and over.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was strange but Mali’s words somehow elicited a certain forbidden feeling in Cat, almost freeing in feeling. One that she could not fully grasp but for some reason made her think of Koona. Maybe that was it -- Koona was the only person she’d ever talked to like this.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But what if you met someone with the ‘spark’ you say?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know,” Mali looked away as Cat just hit the nail on the head, “Thats the problem and the only one.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That same sadness as before overcame Mali as $he looked out and a bit away from Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Complicated, huh?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded. Being in Cat’s presence, this talk, made $er want to cry. And $he was actually aware of it this time, unusually.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well then, here we are, it’s you and I here alone. Each alone - because the tradition has failed to inspire us. Is this good? Are we happy?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Instead of crying, though, Mali channeled it into aggression. The ‘happy’ word didn’t help.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I get more joy out of hoop dancing than I ever got having to fuck a girlfriend. And sorry for the language but that is what they seemed to want, to ‘be fucked’,” all the hurt and disappointment of the past apparently still simmering in the background,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh and they liked my career and money. And add to it that I can talk like this. Intimacy. I was like everything - they had the best of both worlds, that’s why I was special, different and why they were into me. Even that my body is slender and kind of female by default. They had everything they wanted…” Mali looked off contemplating $er next words,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“But… not for me… In the end there was no upside. Work to support them, then when I come home I’m their girlfriend. And then they expect me to be a guy sexually on top of it all because ‘_that’s what I am’_!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck them._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now the tears broke.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I am so sorry. I did not mean to upset you. Just know, I can relate a bit,” she smiled and put her hand on Mali’s forearm. Which in that moment, the connection making the confusion and hurt of feeling so alone vanish.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Don’t worry, you didn’t upset me, this is just me. Upset is when I start breaking things. Like computers. I had this job where I destroyed laptop after laptop and they kept giving me a new one!,” Mali’s lips turned up in a smile at the memory, “It makes me sad to break things that other people worked hard to create.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The tears fell and a sob arose. $he couldn’t put it in words. But it was $erself. The broken, the being broken. $er body. The love in the universe that, just the mere fact that $he existed, this train-wreck of a miracle in the works, on the path to destroy everything systematically. At least that’s how the world and past made $er feel about what $he had been doing these years.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Everything given up. Lost. I could not sustain or hold onto… because of… what I am, me being me. And I’m supposed to stop this._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat reached out and gave Mali a brief and gentle hug with her arm.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“How about we walk and talk about the weather for a bit, shall we?” said Cat tenderly, reaching to dry the tear that was falling. It was strange with Cat, Mali felt okay, really almost disoriented how far $he’d opened. $he hadn't just repeated the words $he'd said over and over to $erself in these years, but $er words were more about how everything felt.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_And saying it aloud to someone ._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat stood and Mali followed the cue.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali was concerned that $he’d gone too far. And that maybe Cat needed to get away from $er. But the anxiety was alleviated feeling the gentle pressure Cat was pulsing into $er hand.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Cat led $er by the hand it made $er remember a dream $he had had many years ago, one of those dreams that for some reason feel most real in comparison to others. Of a beautiful young woman reaching for $er hand and leading $er on a path in the forest. A perfect companion.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The one $he’d trust with $er life. And dedicate $er life to.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The walk and lighter conversation did them both good, which turned into a decision to have dinner nearby at an open restaurant that specialized in delicious seafood and fish. As well as, could be expected, spicy. Which was not lost on them as at one point the whole seating area filled with an almost noxious smoke floating in the air of heated pepper, causing everyone to fan their eyes and many to cough and tear.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They were seated in front of each other, Cat still poised as ever - which Mali had decided by then was simply not even poise but just how she was even at most relaxed, and that it would actually take effort for Cat to be any other way. Tears from the fumes were running down $er cheeks as the coughing started to subside.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat rolled her eyes, gently coughing and smiling.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know I’m going away tomorrow but isn’t this just a little dramatic?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smiled fully back sprouting a chuckle, catching the reference,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I told you honey, its over! Completely over, just walk away and don’t look back!”.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A woman who could not just get a joke but play it. There was nothing better.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’ve enjoyed this afternoon. It’s done me good more than you can imagine.”, thinking to $erself that even ignoring the fact that the spark $he had felt before for Cat had now been exponentially multiplied, if $he could have this afternoon and this friendship, just like this, forever, $he’d take it in place of anyone or anything.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Me too. I’m sad now you’re going away. I know its good for you and given the chance I'd do the same. But selfishly, it would be nice for you to stay here so we can talk more, and gosh, have a little fun.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fun?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe I could stay._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali wanted to say it. But that was thorny. Cat had all but asked $er to stay but, wouldn’t that make things worse, more confusing?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know. It’s crazy to go. But crazy to stay too!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat nodded and they sat in silence for a bit.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“So can we stay in touch? I don’t know, sometime I go to Chiang Mai to be with my family. Maybe we could meet up.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m the one who Facebook friended you!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Once again getting the humor, Cat laughed “Yeah, more than the altar for some of us!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I have to come here pretty regularly for my visa stuff so maybe too,” Mali wanted to say so much more but was not the kind to be direct, “and yes, I would like to know you better, I don’t have many friends and I guess I sometimes blame myself for being closed but in reality, its just not everyday I meet someone I can have a real conversation with that feels good.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“As you say, ‘amen to that’”.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

What blew Mali’s mind was, if Cat’s English was so amazing - she’d never lived in any English speaking country as far as $he knew, what was her Japanese like? To Mali at the moment Cat was like one of these people who pretty much master everything they touch, with no apparent effort.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Shall we get going? I don’t want to keep you out past your bedtime!”, Mali laughed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“In fact, its already past my bedtime,” remarked Cat. Mali noted one more unexpected coincidence between them. It was actually ten o’clock and the evening had flown by.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After splitting the check, they walked to the nearby MRT stop.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I don’t have words”, Mali looked inquiringly at her, shaking $er head, already feeling the sadness that was to come. But $he was conscious, perhaps from the deepening of $er own feminine sense - or the release of masculine acculturation that $he needed to defer to Cat for all things that would point any further than they had already traveled together. In any case $he needed Cat to take the lead, if this would go in the direction that $he undoubtedly longed for. Anyway.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Nor do I really. How about ‘see you soon’?”, Cat did her single eye wink, “does that work?”
