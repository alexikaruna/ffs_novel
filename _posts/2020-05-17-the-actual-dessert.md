Cats room was secluded and dark. At first it seemed windowless but as Cat fumbled with a switch, Mali realized it had just another angle of the amazing view as the windows seemed to lighten in tone magically.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The trajectory into this _other_ room had not been spoken or even decided. Nor with a clear leader. But once there, each on their own felt the unconscious tug of anxiety. Of everything that was _bedroom_ and surrounded it, in each of their cultures. Not to mention as individuals. A place that on your own was of refuge and deepest rest, surrender, even intimacy with oneself. But with another - especially someone new - brought along all the explicit as well as subterfuge.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali held Cat to $er, for some reason with the changed environment once again feeling the jeopardy of ever losing her, realizing too that $he didn’t even _have her._ And Cat felt a little afraid for the first time that night. They had crossed yet another threshold.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Feeling Mali’s embrace, the same from the distant afternoon and the other room comforted her. In the same moment feeling Cat’s embrace back, holding $er tightly, Mali felt reassured.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I don’t know what could be better than what just was, really,” Cat murmured.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded. Truer words. $he’d give up sex itself without hesitation if $he could feel that way forever with someone.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he spoke softly not wanting to disturb anything in the fledgling structure that encompassed them, feeling subconsciously the intruder at their boundary should they not be strong and unified, “I know. How I know. I’m almost afraid to do anything, I feel like what’s here is so special and maybe its fragile. I don’t know.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he secretly hoped that Cat would say something and make it all right, and different. About how she too wanted this, and was sure this would be for much more than tonight.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But that was too far out even for the living fantasy they were in.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali released gently as Cat pushed back so she could look Mali in the eye.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What do you think?” she raised her brows.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was strange suddenly, as for some reason to Mali the way of the question brought back their deepening friendship and how much they shared together over the few months. And $he could feel this thing, both the fact that Cat and $er agreed ‘no expectations beyond tonight’, influenced by the dark thing that was around them and wanted in.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt sad all of the sudden and teared up, “I’m beyond words right now.” &nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I can’t see the bottom but I don’t care.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m gonna jump._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Mali made $er decision a smile arrived, “Come here.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How could we possibly go in any other direction at this point? It would be the worst of all the possible regrets._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They embraced again. Once more with no leader or follower. No man or woman. Just them. Mali knew $he had never ever aside from in $er imagination felt so close and tight with someone. It was literally the dream $he’d held since childhood coming true in $er arms.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The perfect woman._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he started to cry, now in earnest. Because to $er, this was the first time ever with someone that actually felt right. Bonded it felt on all levels, a companion, playmate, intelligence not to mention…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_How she feels in my arms. How I feel. How we… this feels…_&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat neither had never felt this kind of closeness and equality with any of the men she’d been with. She felt Mali convulse softly as $er tears streamed, and knew exactly the feeling as she held $er back in reciprocity.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Out of nowhere she wondered how Koona must have cried that night after the pool at the resort.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I never considered that._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Why?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Their bodies were gently upon each other. An electric charge pulsed between and through their clothes. They were of the same material which wanted only to melt and fuse.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Warm and close.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For all Mali had been exposed in culture about passion, _this_ was $er version of what romance… love… even sex should be. It was never grappling or anything forceful like the movies made it seem. It was soft and gentle, it was the only way $he felt $he could really connect to someone… and wanted to. Everything else was just vulgar and in the end unfulfilling no matter perhaps a momentary high.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt Cat’s arm under $er nightshirt, soft, almost like silk, brushing $er inner thigh. A contact, then pulling away. A test to see. And when Mali’s own body responded, re-seeking that contact from her arm, Cat emboldened, grasping and massaging Mali’s upper inner thigh, now anything but ambiguous.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Desire had come and gone over the evening, and now $er inner sex was building again - not the penis that $he could never really read nor understand - but where $er sexual longing and surrender seemed to originate, from deep inside $er core. As such $he could feel highly aroused but not know if $er penis was actually hard unless it made contact with something.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That something now was Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had never hated $er penis but simply felt let down in its use. It seemed to steal the focus from that deeper place inside by its whispering of irresistible pleasure involving its stimulation and penetration. But the denouement was always a betrayal.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And without knowing something better, this could be accepted as _reality_ aside from the fact that Mali knew something better. Even from childhood that fire was present. When $he did orgasm from $er core, it was full body, and after it $he only wanted more of the person $he was with… to be with and close to $er partner. To spend the day… or forever with _her_. Whereas in the use of the penile appendage, $he would feel sad, repulsed and want to be alone.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So, normally at this point, $he would be worried with a woman, about being able to stay hard, condoms and all that shit only making it worse. It was like $er sexual energy could take an abrupt turn at any moment at the slightest sense of feeling disconnected with $er partner. Which often happened, particularly in relation to the use of $er penis.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But not here. As $he continued feeling Cat’s silky touch make its way up $er back, $he hadn’t noticed Cat simply and transparently lifting herself up, embracing Mali’s hardness between her thighs. Cat looked up and smiled into Mali’s eyes while pouting her lips for another soft kiss.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

* * *
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Come here you,” Cat dropped her hands to Mali’s wrists, leaning backward against $er natural resistance, intimating the direction of the bed. Mali just let $erself relax as Cat’s inertial momentum moved $er forward a few steps, falling onto the bed beside her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali, feeling encouraged, sat up as $er nightshirt dress hiked above $er thighs. $er knees sinking softly into the bed, $he pulled Cat up and put $er hands on Cat’s slender waist. $he needed to be closer to this woman and even these clothes were now too much in the way.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he pulled Cat to $er, caressing Cat’s low back then hooking $her hands under the fitted white camisole pulling upward as Cat raised her arms in affirmation. From what $he could see in the dim light, Cat’s body was creamy and tight. Pulling that beauty again into $er, $he dropped $er hands down and traced upward the front of Cat’s thighs, causing her an involuntary arch of her pelvis and lower back in a luxurious shudder.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he had to be with Cat. It was an interesting place for a human to be in. $he had a penis and the acculturation of a male. But this desire no matter how programmed over, even in Cat’s receptiveness, wasn’t about penetration. Even the brief passing thought of it deflated $er a bit.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali was resolute, and curved $er hands inward, over the black leggings to Cat’s most intimate parts, again causing that brief arch-shudder but then as if in retaliation, Cat thrust her pelvis forward, causing even stronger and more direct contact against Mali’s hands.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat moaned with a little spasm of orgasmic energy up her body. Her mouth dropped open and came in for Mali’s lips as $he hooked $er hands on the waist of the tights and pulled downward.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I want this Mali,” Cat whispered, breathless.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali nodded.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They helped each other liberate the leggings, leaving Cat in her silk black bra and thong, exposing a new musky sweet humidity between them.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat reached up to Mali’s shoulder and pulled herself up to $er face, her body pressing fully on Mali’s still clothed body. Which in another few beats became intolerable so Mali broke the kiss and in one movement liberated $erself from the shirt-dress.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They were a perfect match, both slender, toned and smooth. Feeling Cat’s skin touch full frontal against $er was the electric heaven $he’d been after.&nbsp;
