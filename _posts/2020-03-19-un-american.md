**_Months before..._**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Perched as always at the reception desk, Cat smiled as Mali came through the glass door.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat’s smile, _that_ smile. The one that made $er feel like _the only one_.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The feeling in Mali was a stark contrast to the almost less-than-nobody who $he felt $he was the minute before.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even on the way there, the stares. Just a bit too much laughter apexing as $he passed. $he could never prove it was about $er but assumed it was. $he swore $he heard the word katoey. $he wasn’t sure if it was $er mind playing a game, but $he heard it everywhere. Even in people’s sneezes in passing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The stares meant that $he wasn’t okay.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he’d never really delved into the root feeling.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But to $er it meant $he didn’t look good. Looked funny. Weird.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like a man._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Something is wrong with me._&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Certainly not beautiful or attractive.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_As a female.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Double takes by passers by. They could only mean one thing.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat spoke softly as if to ease Mali out of the barbs $he felt embedded in $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Please have a seat, they’re running a few minutes late but will be with you very soon.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She made full eye contact with a smile that made Mali shy and avert $er eyes. Cat made it feel as if the world $he just came from did not exist. And if that world did not exist, then Mali felt ashamed for the thoughts $he’d been holding about people and the emotions $he’d been having. The frustration and resentment from all the social noise $he read and judged in $erself as being hatred for others.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Here $he was faced with the root dream, the thing $he had always been after, before $he knew anything else. That woman, friend, communion that just made the harshness of the world irrelevant. The one that mattered.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The only one.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_The one._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat rose from her seat at the counter, disappearing through the door to the back for a moment and returning with a pot of green tea and two cups, pouring one for each of them, before returning with hers to her position at the counter. It felt amazing to be around someone whose gentleness and social polish was so impeccable.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A feeling Mali would do anything to hold on to. And to have in every moment in every day with $er future love. Something that seemed to be less and less likely by the day, month and year.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This all was very un-American. Cat’s gift was that she was - well, seemed - authentic. Unused to such treatment, Mali knew too well that $he could easily read something more into it. Friendliness mistaken as friendship. Intimacy meaning attraction. Politeness and grace meaning interest.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Like the Japanese geisha.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Not to mention all the times in life $he was naive and simply proved wrong, left feeling the mud on $er face. But it still did not change the feeling because the longing could not be erased. The thirst was too great.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Thank you for always being so kind to me here,” Mali smiled at Cat as $he returned to the white waiting room couch following $er treatment. There was a new cup of tea waiting for $er.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_She wants me to stay longer?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Otherwise why should she bring me a second cup today?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Of course.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I know this is your job but you are just amazing at it. I think you should run for Miss Thailand, you embody for me what is the best of the Thai culture.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Yes, let me reinforce a bit more and pathetically of how I feel about you._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Stupid.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt uncomfortable in $er own skin in the moment. Everything felt confused… how $he looked, what $he was doing - trying to show $er interest in a woman. The mixed signals felt like they were like a bunch of disparate radio waves in the air.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

However being attracted to anyone lately was usual for $er. It was maybe once a year now. Part was loss of hope, another part confusion, and part homage to all the reasons $he imagined why no one would be into $er. And so it had been.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smiled back with a slight blush and turning down her head, shaking it ‘no’ but yet clearly with a further building smile but hidden similarly as to one who is trying to hold back laughter or tears but only making it worse.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Shyly looking back up just with her eyes, she said,

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I got your Facebook friend request and said yes.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled inside poking fun at $erself.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Oh really shameless stalker... jesus._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Sipping slowly in silence, in a moment Cat asked “did everything go well?”.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah, in spite of the pain I actually got a little nap”.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled to $erself at the joke. It was kind of nice barely being able to communicate with the laser operator. As with so much else in Thailand, a kind of permitted ignorance. Except for…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Thats good. So what are you doing now, are you still getting ready to go to Chiang Rai?”.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

At that moment the doctor and the other remaining staff member at the clinic hustled by apologizing with a quick good-bye and that she was late for an appointment. Leaving Cat and Mali for the first time apparently alone.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well, I’m kind of ready. I really don’t have too many things and I have moved so so many times over the last few years that I can pack in my sleep,” pausing to try what $he hoped would work,&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“How about you, big plans for this evening?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_So fucking transparent.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$er feeling of scarcity and desperation not even registering behind $er generally prevalent mask of tension, especially while interacting with others.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No, well not really, I was going to take the MRT up to Chatuchak Park and take a stroll, maybe sit a bit and relax. That’s one place in the city that helps me refresh.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I’m surprised, I would have thought you would be out on the town having dinner with your friends, or dessert,” once again remembering the photos $he stalked on Cat's Instagram. Half of them were of what appeared like good times with friends, other half, food. Quarter of those, beautiful desserts.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was a conscious decision of Cat to open a door for Mali. It was because for some reason she felt more out of sorts whenever Mali came in. Add to that Mali seemed to want to be friends. For some reason this foreigner made so much of her life and home in Thailand seem unreal and lonely, regardless of how generally gregarious and abundant her social life was. Mali was different and for some reason she wanted to know more.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You would think?” Cat looked down dwelling a moment on all this, “Well you have a lot to know about me yet! I’m actually boring, so I am told,” she raised her eyes and smiled genuinely in her masterful reversal of what might have been construed as immodesty.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

&nbsp;“Well, for what its worth you wear that persona well - if it’s true which I truly doubt,” Mali smiled, “I just am what I am and its hard for me to put on a persona, so I envy you. I feel like I'm an open book, it just takes someone to ask me something and I spill it! I would be a disaster at your job!” shaking $er head, “Oh, and for the record, I am a horrible horrible liar. My body does not cooperate!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat smiled, shaking her head, “Well maybe I have a lot to know about you too. And at least now I know you can’t lie to me, huh?” she paused a beat, “I also expected you to be a bit wild and out on the town, I don’t know, with your friends? Or with a boyfriend?”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali felt a slight recoil inside, the ‘bf’ word. An immediate impulse hit to clarify being misread.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I’m not gay.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Not a gay man.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Damn it, not a man._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I don’t want you to see a man. But I want you to like me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s true gayness was not even on the radar yet.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Well thats one more thing for you to know. I don’t like men.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat looked down appearing a little puzzled, perhaps slightly embarrassed yet thoughtful.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Sorry, maybe too much information,” Mali added.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_But how the fuck could I not say it?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Hmmmm, yes thats also interesting and I bet a story behind that too.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah. I need a lot of quiet and solitude too, I bet more than you. So I don’t forget who I am. That’s also why I feel I need to go live up north.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali paused for a moment appearing nonchalant and thoughtful but in reality anything but that.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I don’t know, would you perhaps like company at the park? I can be quiet if you just want to relax and contemplate, I promise.”, $he said with a smile and a little of the trademark Cat ‘wink’. For some reason $he was always a sponge for mannerisms $he found in women $he found special.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You know, I would enjoy that.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali felt an edge for a second, worried for a minute Cat was saying this just to be polite.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I really mean it,” Cat added, as if reading Mali’s mind, “it will be fun!”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I need someone from the outside of everything to talk to. Maybe you’re that person.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_There are things on my mind, maybe you can help.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Maybe you can._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was pretty anathema in her culture to even have this thought not to mention act on it. But it was what she felt in the moment, the seed starting with Mali's friend request.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali felt at ease again and smiled, “Great!”.
