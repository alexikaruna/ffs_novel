“Chan chop gin puk gup kaew ka,” Mali completed the sentence perfectly albeit mechanically.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Kaa kaa!” Kuhn Nok, the teacher at the whiteboard affirmed, “Jonathan, _poot arai Mali na Angrit ka? --_ Jonathan, can you translate what Mali said?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“He likes to eat vegetables and rice?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The teacher smiled in partial acknowledgment and corrected, “SHE likes to eat vegetables and rice. Remember, ‘ka’ at the end is for female, ‘krup’ is for male.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The other student, a big black guy from Chicago, looked about to protest but thought better of it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s lips turned up in a smile.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck me. She’s correcting people on my gender_. _All for the price of using the ‘ka’ instead of the ‘krup’ at the end of the sentence.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

He had had no ‘identity conversation’ with the teacher or anyone in the class. Not the usual crap you had to do in English if you want something when you don’t meet the standard the culture has set for you to be yourself: ‘_I identify as female and use the pronouns she, her and hers…’_ and all that bullshit.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It seemed obnoxious to $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Something Mali had no heart for because…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I don’t look to people like a woman. I look like a rockstar. Or a gay guy.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_A gay rockstar probably._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I would have to go around the world telling everyone then. I don’t want to force people to make me be what they don’t see in me themselves._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Uphill battle._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And there was the latent truth that $he did not even realize at the core…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_I want to see and be seen. For who and what I am. And on the trajectory I’m on, if I can’t have that… I’m truly destroying my life._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck me._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck you English.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Fuck you puritan creepy fuck-off American culture.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Thailand is so much easier._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The fact was, below the surface as it was, Mali’s pronoun and gender for him, her, or whatever ‘self’ depended upon the world. How others seemed to define him, her, them, whatever. Setting up a perpetual conflict with others and the world.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And reading the above paragraph you can get the sucky confusion and wordiness if you don’t know which pronoun to use for someone…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Or what is right with yourself._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So in this moment Mali wrote proudly in the notebook in block, double embossing each letter…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

**$HE**  
**$ER**  
**$ERSELF**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_For now that’s what I am.&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Like a variable in computer code.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A variable in code is a placeholder which at least in some languages can be assigned anything… and generally changed while the program runs.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he = ‘she’  
$he = ‘he’  
$he = ‘Mali’  
$he = ‘Mark’  
$he = 12345  
$he = [‘The’, ‘Real’, ’Fuckface’, ‘Von’, ‘Clownstick’].join(‘ ’)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A placeholder, and what’s inside is changeable. A work in progress. Like a shell in a shell game, you may know which shell contains the item, but the shell itself is not the thing inside it, which you may or may not know what it is.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If you’re hacking into some code, you may see the variable but until you look inside it, you don’t know for sure what it contains. It might have a nice name like...

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$Cassandra

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But look inside… what is in there?&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The world… the people outside see only the variable, not what its value is. And they make inferences and judgements based on only that. Which you can imagine makes it hard for someone like this:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$BigTallMan = ‘Jessica’

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Especially when SHE walks into a bathroom in some hick town in Texas.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That’s why $he came back to Thailand. Thailand seemed to be less obsessed with coupling the variable name - its shell - to what was inside and made the country a good playground, compared to many places. It did not have the often present threat of outrage and violence that the US seemed to hold.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali’s naive thoughts upon making the travel plans were - and without timeline - maybe try out hormones, a couple of relatively minor surgeries to if not become female in appearance, at least a lot cuter…&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Harmonize my variable… my container…_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And do due diligence to know what this mystery inside _actually is_.
