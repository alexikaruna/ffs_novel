<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Looking down at the puddles they were walking through, both with reasonably nice shoes, clothes that were virtually plastered to their slender frames, Mali smiled.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he felt like a child playing in the rain and being led away by $er care giver, with tears and red eyes from a tantrum. What the tantrum was about? It was about a purple lollipop, she decided. Remembering an actual time they had run out of the purple ones at the doctors.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he smiled an internal laughter and grin sprouting from inside out.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A sweet surrender to the elements. Letting go and just being in how $he felt and in the weather. With Cat leading the way. Lighter than in ages.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It felt like before with Cat, back to the day in Chiang Mai. Funny how going back to even just ambiguity felt so good.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They walked. And walked. Blocks, puddles, dodging mopeds whose second road was the sidewalk and even more so in rush hour rain. Which on many days was simply annoying if not frightening. But today seemed rather hilarious and special in its lawlessness. That was the best way Mali could understand $er feeling of being more alive in the ‘third world’ than $er own country. It reminded $er of the true fragility of life and the depth of feeling that seemed to have been paved over in the USA.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After a while and growing listless, in the child spirit which had overcome $er, spotting a big puddle Mali’s eyes widened and as they passed to it, and with all $er weight $he jumped into it, soaking Cat, in vein of course.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With her hands up in avoidance and a little scream, Cat succumbed to a laugh, shaking her head.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“No you don’t.”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She grabbed into her open bag and pulled out a small bottle of some sort of red soda. It didn’t take more than an instant for Mali to realize what was going to happen next.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Nooooooo!” $he cringed, as the liquid met $er skin, smelling cherry, knowing how sticky this would be, but Cat was relentless until the bottle was empty, hair, back, front, down $er shirt for good measure, and tears were now flowing along with the mascara lines, down Cat’s laughing face.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

People were passing, looking, questioning. A slender farang and a Thai woman, acting strange. As if it was Songkran (the Thai water festival). But it wasn’t. One by one, they entered Memory Erase mode and went on, never to recall the scene again.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali in $er own laughter, shaking $er head looked at Cat from the corner of $er eyes, “Cat, I don’t even care anymore how you take this,” $he paused to emphasize, “I love you. If it were up to me…” She said so lucidly and coherently it switched from the child-play context to something equally special but honest in depth, catching Cat off-guard.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That moment everything stopped. Cat’s mouth and jaw dropped. $he started getting it, the one and only way Cat could lose her perfect poise was whenever it hit close to home.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali stopped. No further words, shrugged and smiled as if in apology for the shock but not the content.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Cat recovered her composure, which she noted seemed to be regularly necessary when Mali was around. She reached to Mali and pulled $er on with her right arm.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I think we better get you somewhere where you can dry off. I think you’ve become delirious.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The dismissal would have been a hard hit, especially from the fall from the clouds they were riding, except for the sideways look and wink smile Cat delivered with the message.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Magic._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat could feel something pushing up and above the surface of consciousness, almost through her.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Who was this Mali?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Am I right about Mali?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Really katoey?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Female inside?&nbsp;_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_What does it mean if I like it… enjoying getting close?_

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Right then surfaced the moment of that almost kiss at the pool with Koona. Unconsciously her smile and feeling of aliveness broadened. Something let go in her pelvis deep down that she had never felt before it seemed. It was freeing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Are we there yet?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They had been walking for over twenty minutes and Mali had slipped back to fun-child mode. The warm humidity had started to take over again in the wake of the rain, making the feeling of $er wet clothes, hair and skin to be like a sticky paste.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Right around the corner,” Cat smiled no-nonsense playing the parent par-excellence.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Where are we going?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“You’ll see,” shaking her head in good humor like a parent being tested.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They turned left and went half a block. They were now in front of a tall pristine white condominium tower which looked like marble. ‘Klong Toei Tower’ was the sign.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“What’s this?” Mali questioned.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Home.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Are you serious???”&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was a disbelief that really shouldn’t have been by now. It was one of _those_ skyrises. The one’s $he always saw and wondered about but from a distance. These buildings had a lot to do with the big city elite feeling of Bangkok. And $he’d never been inside one.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Yet another chapter in the unbelievable life of Cat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Yeah. Come on!” hurried Cat as she swiped her keycard. As they entered an open elevator waited.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

She punched floor 44. At the top they exited and turned left. 4400. Somehow the even numbered ‘0’ unit made it so much more elegant than say, 4401. The thought passed through Mali’s ever active mind.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat opened the door and immediately discarded her shoes as Mali did the same. Not only a Thai custom to not wear shoes in the house - which was something Mali had been doing on her own for years - but tonight it was just common sense. Rain, city mud, muck, motorcycle grease, red soda…

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Let me see,” Cat pondered and seemed to come to a conclusion.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“I have two bathrooms. Assuming you don’t need a bathtub, why don’t you take the one here to the right,” she motioned down a little niche-like hall to the right after the entry, “I’ll use mine. I’ll bring you some clothes, okay?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Perfect!” was all Mali could say. $he could see beyond the foyer what looked like a treat. Being overwhelmed in new experiences and sensations once again with Cat, $er life shifted once again to a new version of surreal. Complete feast or complete famine and virtually no middle ground.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

They parted and Mali entered the all white bathroom and began to draw a shower.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After a lot of warm water savoring, and liberal amounts of cherry soap and jasmine-coconut shampoo that looked and smelled good enough to eat, Mali exited the shower and wrapped a towel. Playing with $er hair, there was a light knock at the door “Are you decent?”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“It depends what you mean. But if you mean wrapped in a towel, yes!” $er words sending play and smile. It was funny how $he’d lost self-consciousness of $er voice, and at the same time $er true voice came more easily, feeling and sounding so much more authentic to $er.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Cat entered with a perfectly folded item which she held and fanned, “It’s one of my night shirts, if nothing else it should fit and be comfortable,” and then with a wink, she produced some cute boyshort panties, “and these, a bit too big for me but I bet fit you perfectly.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali smiled and nodded. The cotton of the shirt felt heavenly soft as Cat passed it to $er. It seemed too to mean Cat was holding the door open to keeping $er there for a bit.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Oh,” and as if from nowhere two additional items appeared, “Here’s a razor and cream.”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali broke into laughter, $he had forgotten about the stubble.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The items proffered spoke volumes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Okay okay. I know. Geesh!”

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he’d be happy to be rid of it, forever. A spark of warmth permeated through $er body, now clean and starting to feel once again normal. The feeling of the soft, plush white carpet under her feet was electric, $he rubbed them back and forth feeling the warm friction. $he had not done this since $er teenage years, and probably never had felt so warm, comfortable and protected since childhood. $he pinched $erself but it didn’t hurt at all, $he felt too good!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Mali caressed the white panties which were just as soft as the shirt. She could feel energy build between her legs. They would feel good, and $he slipped them on, tucked herself under, they fit hotly, from front and especially back as they perfectly emphasized her minimal but firm behind.&nbsp;

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

$he looked in the mirror, grabbed the comb and ran it through $er hair. $he looked cute. It worked. Taking advantage of the moisturizer on the counter $he had noticed earlier, $he coated $er face.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

“Are you coming?” Cat whined from across the apartment, “You’re slower than a wom… geez, oh, okay,” she corrected herself. Mali shook $er head smiling.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Ready, $he opened $er door and made $er way.
